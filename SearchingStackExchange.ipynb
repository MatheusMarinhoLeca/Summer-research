      "Full Question: Greedy algorithms are well known, and although useful in a local context for certain problems, and even potentially find general, global optimal solutions, they nonetheless trade optimality for shorter-term payoffs.\n",

      "Original Question: A Quest for Maximizing Expected Value: Optimizing Algorithmic Trading Parameters\n",
      "Full Question: I am engaged in algorithmic trading, employing specialized models that utilize various parameters to signal trading opportunities. Once I get a signal, I could execute a trade and everything is determine in advance, i.e. I know the entry point, the exit point and I have a stop loss if the price goes against me.\n",
      "While the existing models are functional and able to generate these signals, I'm facing a challenge in optimizing the parameters to maximize the expected value of my trading strategy. I'm aware that this optimization is likely an iterative process, but I currently lack a systematic method to tweak the parameters effectively.\n",
      "One example of this challenge is the identification of a \"gap-up short pattern.\" A threshold such as a 70% gap in pre-market trading affects the expected value, and I suspect that there may be an optimal percentage that can enhance my results further. However, I'm uncertain how to explore different thresholds methodically to find this optimal value.\n",
      "I'm keen on exploring optimization techniques that are tailored to my situation, taking into consideration my data constraints and the nature of the trading models. My goal is to find a robust yet practical approach to iteratively fine-tune these critical parameters, thereby maximizing the expected value without risking overfitting or adding undue complexity.\n",
      "I have not yet embarked on any specific optimization method, and I'm actively seeking guidance on the best course of action to address this specific challenge.\n",
      "EDIT I have thought using a reinforcement learning approach, but I am not sure at all it would be possible. I have about 2000 to 3000 signals per models so the data seems a bit limited. I thought using a Bayesian Optimization approach. What do you think about that?\n",

      "Original Question: Loss Function In Units Of Bits?\n",
      "Full Question: Where can I find a machine learning library that implements loss functions measuring the Algorithmic Information Theoretic-friendly quantity \"bits of information\"?\n",
      "To illustrate the difference between entropy, in the Shannon information sense of \"bits\" and the algorithmic information sense of \"bits\", consider the way these two measures treat a 1 million character string representing $\\pi$:\n",
      "Shannon entropy \"bits\" ($6$ for the '.'):  $\\lceil 1e6*\\log_2(10) \\rceil+6$\n",
      "Algorithmic \"bits\":  The length, in bits, of the shortest program that outputs 1e6 digits of $\\pi$ .\n",
      "All statistical measures of information, such as KL divergence, are based on Shannon information.  By contrast, algorithmic information permits representations that are fully dynamical as in Chomsky type 0, Turing Complete, etc. languages.  Since the world in which we live is dynamical, algorithmic models are at least plausibly more valid in many situations than are statistical models.  (I recognize that recursive neural nets can be dynamical and that they can be trained with statistical loss functions.)\n",
      "For a more authoritative and formal description of these distinctions see the Hutter Prize FAQ questions Why aren't cross-validation or train/test-set used for evaluation? and Why is Compressor Length superior to other Regularizations? For a paper-length exposition on the same see \"A Review of Methods for Estimating Algorithmic Complexity: Options, Challenges, and New Directions\".\n",
      "From what I can see, machine learning makes it difficult to relate loss to algorithmic information.  Such an AIT-friendly loss function must, by definition, measure the number of bits required to reconstruct, without loss, the original training dataset.\n",
      "Let me explain with examples of what I mean by AIT-friendly loss functions, starting with the baby-step of classification loss (usually measured as cross-entropy):\n",
      "Let's say your training set consists of $P$ patterns belonging to $C$ classes. You can then construct a partial AIT loss function providing the length of the corrections to the model's classifications with a $P$-length vector, each element containing a $0$ if the model was correct for that pattern, or the class if not.  These elements would each have a bit-length of $\\lceil \\log_2(C+1) \\rceil$, and be prefixed by a variable length integer storing $P$.  The more $0$ elements, the more compressible this correction vector until, in the limit, a single run-length code for $P$ $0$'s is stored as the correction, prefixed by $P$ and the length of the binary for the RLE algorithm itself. The bit-length of these, taken together, would comprise this partial loss function.\n",
      "This is a reasonable first cut at an AIT-friendly loss function for classification error.\n",
      "So now let's go one step further to outputs that are numeric, the typical approach is a summation of a function of individual error measures, such as squaring or taking their absolute value or whatever -- perhaps taking their mean.  None of these are in units of bits of information.  To provide the correction on the outputs to reproduce the actual training values requires, again, a vector of corrections.  This time it would be deltas, the precision of which must be adequate to the original data being losslessly represented, hence requiring some sort of adaptive variable length quantity representation(s).  These deltas would likely have a non-uniform distribution so they can be arithmetically encoded.  That seems like a reasonable approach to another AIT-friendly loss function.\n",
      "But now we get to the \"model parameters\" and find ourselves in the apparently well-defined but ill-founded notions like \"L2 regularization\", which are defined in terms of ill-defined \"parameters\", e.g. \"parameter counts\" aren't given in bits.\n",
      "I'll grant that L2 regularization sounds like it is heading in the right direction by squaring the weights and summing them up, but when one looks at what is actually being done, it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "applying additional functions to the sum such as mean\n",
      "asking for a scaling factor to apply\n",
      "applying the regularization on a per-layer basis rather than the entire model\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure I missed some of the many ways L2 regularization fails to be AIT-friendly.\n",
      "Finally, there is the model's pseudo-invariance, measured, not simply in terms of its hyperparameters but in terms of the length of the (compressed archive of the) actual executable binary running on the hardware.  I say 'pseudo' because there is nothing that says one cannot vary, say, the number of neurons in a neural network during learning -- nor even change to another learning paradigm than neural networks during learning (in the most general case).\n",
      "So that's pretty much the complete loss function down to the Universal Turing Machine iron, but I'd be happy to see just a reference to an existing TensorFlow or another library that tries to do even a partial loss function for AIT-theoretic learning.\n",

      "Full Question: In reinforcement learning book from Sutton & Barto (2018 edition), specifically in section 7.5 of the book, they present an n-step off-policy algorithm that doesn't require importance sampling called n-step tree backup algorithm. \n",
      "In other algorithms, the return in the update consisted of rewards along the way and the estimated value(s) of the node(s) at the bottom, but, in tree backup update, a return consists of things mentioned before plus the estimated values of the actions that weren't picked during these n steps, all weighted by the probability of taking the action from the previous step.  \n",

      "Why is this algorithm considered an off-policy algorithm? As far as I could notice, only a single target policy is mentioned and there is no talk about behaviour policy generating actions to take.\n",
      "In control we want our target policy to be deterministic, greedy policy, so how do we exactly generate actions to take in this case since behaviour policy isn't used? If we generate actions from the greedy policy, we won't explore, so we won't learn the optimal policy. What am I missing here?\n",
      "If I understood something wrong and we are actually using behaviour policy, I don't understand how would the update work in the case where our target policy is greedy. The return consists of estimates taken from actions that weren't picked, but, because our policy is greedy, the probabilities used in calculating those estimates would be 0, so the total estimate of those actions would be 0 as well. The only non 0 probability in our target policy is the one of the greedy action (which is the probability of 1), so the entire return would fall down to n-step SARSA return. So, basically, how are we allowed to do this update in this case, why is this return allowed to replace the one with importance sampling?\n",

      "Full Question: United States federal tax returns tend to be written in ALL CAPS to facilitate OCR. This practice has persisted even when returns are filed electronically. Thus, much of the text in the IRS 990 dataset is in all caps. This makes it hard to read, and limits the ability of algorithms such as Treebank to accurately tag part of speech.\n",
      "I understand that the approach of the Stanford POS tagger may be more amenable to correction of capitalization, but in practice, I have not had much luck in using it to correct the text in the IRS 990 corpus, in which nearly every sentence contains one or more proper nouns.\n",
      "Are there any \"tricks of the trade\" for improving the performance of an off-the-shelf POS tagger when using ALL CAPS text, and/or an algorithm that may do better at identifying the proper nouns therein? \n",

      "Original Question: What are machine learning algorithms which rank films?\n",
      "Full Question: Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to producing lists of the best films: human vs machine curation.\n",
      "Human curation involves someone, a critic, making decisions and/or creating a canon, based on some criteria for selection. This person specifies a subset of films which in their view belong in a pantheon of the best films ever made. Human curation is ad hoc, bespoke, subjective, thoughtful, usually involves a small set of information wrt criteria or features, and so on. Examples of this include the AFI's 100 Best American Films; 1,000 Films to See Before You Die; A Cinema History for the silent film era and books such as Gilbert Adair's Flickers: An Illustrated Celebration of 100 Years of Cinema, and many more. Criteria can include box office ticket sales, IMDB popularity ratings, critic's annual lists of best of reviews, industry awards, nominations, etc.\n",
      "Machine curation, on the other hand, can involve large, even huge, amounts of data and features and an algorithm of some type which statistically evaluates films to produce a ranked list of the best films. Here, the most subjective part of the process involves the selection of features used and the films included, otherwise, the process is intended to be fully automated.\n",
      "Rotten Tomatoes is an example of a hybrid approach to film curation as there is a panel of approved critics and a panel of people responsible for aggregating and rating the reviews of the approved critics, as explained on the About Rotten Tomatoes web page,\n",

      "Full Question: Dear DataScience Community, I am working on class imbalance tabular data with high-dimension inputs.

      "I used MLP, CatBoostClassifier, and SVM for the task, with CatBoostClassifier giving me the best result. To address the data classification accuracy, I implemented oversampling, undersampling(losing a large chunk of features of classes with higher count), SMOTE, GSMOTE, and an algorithmic approach where I assigned weight during the model training part in CatBoostClassifier with class_weights parameter. The best result is when I used the algorithmic approach assigning the class_weights.\n",

      "By incremental I mean an algorithm that builds clusters starting from an initial dataset and that is able to progressively ingest new items/observations adding them to existing or new clusters.\n",
      "The maximum number of clusters is a priori unknow and is expected to grow over time, meaning that, after the algorithm have been run on the initial dataset, I expect to receive observations that belongs to never before seen clusters.\n",

      "Original Question: Algorithm generated fines\n",
      "Full Question: In the UK, there was recently a case in the press about a driver that was issued a fine for driving in a bus lane. The photograph the Local Authority supplied as \"evidence\" was of someone wearing an item of clothing with wording that was similar to the number plate of his car.\n",
      "Clearly, this fine was issued by software and no human being was actually involved in the process. Apparently this is acceptable.\n",
      "My question is, this behaviour is so egregious, does the \"offender\" have the right to completely ignore the fine and all its auto-generated escalation correspondence, until an actual human being finally looks at it, realises the error and quashes the case?\n",
      "If he did ignore it completely, and the first human to see it were a judge, would that judge 1) have sympathy for his situation and reprimand the Local Authority for wasting the court's time, or 2) take a dim view of his lack of action to get the case quashed at an earlier stage?\n",
      "If 2), what if this item of clothing became fashionable and was therefore causing this person to receive hundreds of these fines every week?\n",
      "EDIT: In response to @motosubatsu's answer, in particular my \"fashionable item\" aspect. I suppose by \"fashionable item\" I was intending to cover a larger topic which I could summarise like this: Suppose I want to annoy somebody as much as possible, what's to stop me from printing a t-shirt with their actual number plate on it, then walking around past all sorts of cameras, knowing that  they will receive multiple fines every day and have no choice but to keep calling and explaining. After all, the council has no duty to make it easy for someone to get through on the phone, so, potentially, I could  walk around bus lanes and car parks all day. I could get some friends to do this all over the country in different local authority areas and the victim could - literally - have not enough hours in the day to have to keep fighting false fines. Would they not have some recourse to sue for harassment or \"vexatious litigation\"?\n",

      "Aren't computer algorithms mathematical equations? Any algorithm can be represented mathematically. People may argue that even physical objects like engines can be expressed mathematically, but physical objects are obviously different from mathematical expressions. But how are algorithms different from mathematical equations? Many machine learning algorithms exactly satisfy the definition of mathematical equations, as they were directly derived from statistical methods used in the past (which I believe were not patentable before the software era). Of course, an animation created by an artist, cannot be considered as a mathematical work, even if the software uses multiple mathematical methods to make it function.\n",

      "Original Question: Where is the line between patentable algorithms and copyrightable creative expression in software?\n",
      "Full Question: My understanding is that algorithms are protected by patents, and creative expression is protected by copyright.  This could be illustrated by the following hypothetical:\n",
      "Suppose a company releases a bit of software implementing some novel algorithm, say WinZip with a new better compression method.  This is released under some conventional closed source licence and distributed as compiled object code.\n",
      "Alice buys a copy of this software, looks at the object code that performs the compression, extracts the algorithm as a mathematical formula and reimplements the algorithm.  She then puts this code in a software product.\n",
      "Bob buys a copy of this software, puts the object code that performs the compression through a decompiler, takes the resulting few hundred lines of code and puts this code in a software product.\n",
      "If the company has a patent on the algorithm then both of these software products would infringe upon this patent.  If the company has no patent and is relying on copyright to protect their product, my understanding is that while Bob would infringe, as the decompiled code would include creative expression that was in the original code, Alice would be in the clear as she only takes the mathematical logic.\n",
      "Now suppose instead of a human, Alice or Bob, we have an machine learning system, perhaps a large language model like Github Copilot but working from object code rather than text prompts and actually checking the functionality as it goes.  What features would we look at to determine if there is a breach of copyright?  Would it be the output, how similar is it, how many different ways of doing the same thing are there?  Would it be the details of the operation of the machine learning system?  Would it be details of the task being solved, where a simple algorithm would receive less protection than a complex system?\n",
      "As far as jurisdiction is concerned the question probably would be: Can you do what is described anywhere and distribute the product everywhere?  Assuming this procedure is NOT performed in the USA would probably simplify the issue.\n",

      "My main question here is whether it's legal or not. My current points of consideration are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether this framework is patented or not. I haven't found any information about it and to be honest I don't even know where to look for. Is it protected from replication by default (copyright law)? They only thing I found is this \"default\" header in CoreImage.h file:\n",

      "\n",
      "UPD:\n",
      "Just to make it clear - I don't have CoreImage source code (I guess no one besides Apple does) and I can't/don't intend to use it anyways. I don't have any particular code-written implementation at hand. My primary concern is all about Design.\n",

However, it's often up to lay citizens to notice these discrepancies and take them to court for appeal. Even when the cases are very clear-cut, it can take months or years, and by the time it's done, a whole new set of quick-and-dirty executive regulations may have come out.\n",

      "Original Question: Mathematical models of dynamic algorithmic processes\n",
      "Full Question: This question primarily concerns dynamical or time-dependent phenomena in philosophy and to what extent such heuristic discourse features in more precise mathematical settings.\n",
      "In order to model dynamical phenomena, whether in set theoretic, categorical, etc. backgrounds, one often uses directed graph structures, e.g. transition system, which of course necessitates a priori knowledge of the possible outputs. Arguably, the a priori vs a posteriori existence of abstract structures is only a psychological distinction, and I'm wondering how one would model this psychological phenomena mathematically.\n",
      "To be more precise, suppose we are constructing a formal system within a fixed background meta-theory. In other words, everything we use to construct the system must exist in the meta-theory a priori. Often, one observes dynamical processes built within a formal system which allows the user to generate new strings within the system on demand only beginning with primitives, without necessitating all pre-generated strings to be built into the formal system a priori.\n",
      "1) Do all such possible output strings as a result of some built-in algorithmic process in the formal system, necessarily exist a priori in the meta-theory itself?\n",
      "2) If so, is it accurate that a naive psychological analogy be that the human brain plays the role of the formal system which undergoes a dynamical procedure learning more strings and that the meta-theory contain the brain and some external stimuli which in some sense contains all the possible strings?\n",
      "3) It seems that many finitist responses to constructing a formal system with arbitrarily many symbols are to have an in-built procedure within the formal system which generates new symbols on demand. (I am referring to the stronger finitist stance of objecting even to an algorithmic infinite sequence of symbols). But then, given the above considerations, wouldn't all such symbols necessarily be contained in the meta-theory itself, thus violating the objection to having infinitely many symbols in the meta-theory to begin with?\n",
      "4) If the above is true, it seems that one necessitates an infinite meta-theory to model a finitist theory. This seems to correlate with the incompleteness theorems in that most of the time, weaker systems cannot prove consistency of stronger systems. Can the correlation between this consistency no-go theorem and the above considerations be made more precise?\n",
      "Please let me know what I am missing if the above are incorrect due to a misunderstanding in the meta-theory/theory relationship and the definition of such algorithms/procedures.\n",

      "Full Question: There exists a precise criterion of what counts as valid mathematics and what doesn't. By the word precise, I mean algorithmic. There exists a known algorithm that will take as input a pair consisting of axioms, and reasoning of a mathematician written in a formal language and output valid or invalid. It is amazing that this algorithm and formal language exist, because this solved the demarcation problem of mathematics (almost) completely. If I am not mistaken about the history, I believe the origins of this work can be traced back to philosophers of mathematics Frege and Russell. Unfortunately, the analogous thing has not been accomplished in philosophy of science as far as I am aware. I am interested in knowing if there are known solutions to the problems below:\n",

      "Do any philosophers of science propose solutions to any of the above 2 problems in the philosophical literature , i.e. Did any philosopher of science try to accomplish what Frege, Russell tried to accomplish  ?\n",
      "Note: I am aware of some proposals for  solutions to the demarcation problem like naive induction, hypothetico-deductive method, Popper's falsification. My problem with all of these approaches is that they are either don't capture what scientific activity is or are  not algorithmic and so fail to give an airtight solution to the demarcation problem.\n",
      "Another note:  when I say science in the above text, I am mostly thinking about  physics, a domain which has the most potential to be well defined and admit an algorithmic solution to its demarcation problem.\n",

The comments I am getting so far are neither of these two options, but they instead try to persuade me that I should not be looking for an answer to these two problems.\n",

Can I find any book on this topic?\n",
      "I have a computer science background. While I was studying Computer Science I noticed a lot of analogies between these 2 domains (Philosophy and CS). Our brains behave like computers. Our thoughts are like threads. We have unconsciously algorithmic thinking when we want to give a solution to a problem.

      "Full Question: After years of studying Plato I have seen some attempts to formalize somehow Plato's dialectics. To be more precise, I have found writers who present Plato's dialectics (especially as it is presented in Phaedros, Parmenides, Politikos, Sophistes) in a more or less \"algorithmic-step analytical\" way. Though I have never found a strictly formal, axiomatic establishment. I cannot prove it but I am intuitively almost sure that Plato's dialectics can be formalized.

      "Original Question: Why is it impossible for a program or AI to have semantic understanding?\n",
      "Full Question: relatively new to philosophy.\n",
      "This question is based on John Searle's Chinese Room Argument.\n",
      "I find it odd that his main argument for why programs could not think was that because programs could only follow syntax rules but could not associate any understanding or semantics to words( or any object/symbol).\n",
      "This point seems contestable to me (although I can't quite word it well enough). How is John so certain that it would be impossible for a program to understand semantics? Is mimicking semantic understanding actually different from genuine semantic understanding?\n",
      "What does philosophy say about whether it is truly impossible for mankind to one day develop a program capable of semantic understanding? According to Turing's Same-Evidence Argument, if a computer can pass the test, we would have to assume that it is capable of understanding. Could we even distinguish between simulated mimicking understanding and actual understanding?\n",
      "Edit: wow this really blew up. Thank you for the answers!\n",
      "Sidenote:\n",
      "I posited this question partly because John's visualization of what a program looks like seems flawed to me. He is able to clearly break-down and visualize a program (the room) with a 'core' (the man in the room) in the middle that handles the inputs and produces the outputs.\n",
      "However, complex algorithmic programs aren't designed in such a simple manner. Take Artifical Neural Networks for example, which are said to be \"black-boxes\" due to the fact that we can't break down a neural network into components to deduce how it decides to give certain outputs. John's arguement seems built on the fact that we could 'peer' into how programs/algorithms make decisions when that isn't necessarily true.\n",
      "Chess algorithms such as the infamous Deep Blue and Alpha Zero sometimes produce moves that professional chess players fail to consider. Would John argue that these algorithms \"fail to understand Chess?\". It seems flawed to say that the program fails in semantic understanding when it can display creativity which human chess players themselves may lack.\n",

      "A significant part of the petition identifies child sexual abuse as the justification for attacking on cyber security. It reiterates the number of child-protecting organizations who are working on the problem of child abuse, however it never explains why this type of crime should be the main reason for demanding security backdoors.\n",
      "For example, it is known that encrypted communications have been used for coordinating the effort of criminals involved in drug trafficking, international terrorism, arms sales, assassinations and torture, and even in manipulating elections in foreign countries.\n",
      "Why do these politicians so… ermm… exaggeratedly demonstrate their concern about the child abuse, but not about other — no less serious and evident — crimes?\n",
      "My first guess (and this is why I emphasize that they who signed the Statement are on the far-right of the political spectrum) is that the government control over everything is basically more of a left-wing agenda, while personal privacy is the concept the right-wings usually defend. This Statement is something completely different, and this makes me think that the sides of a political spectrum might be the key for answering this question. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n",

      "Original Question: In Bundestag election, can a party abuse the system by endorsing independents in constituency (first vote) races?\n",
      "Full Question: In its federal election, Germany uses mixed-member proportional representation, where a voter makes two votes: one picks a particular candidate in local constituency, second for a party. In short, a constituency seat is won by candidate who reached plurality of votes. Parties, that have achieved 5% votes on party lists are allocated extra seats so that at the end of the day percentage of their seats roughly corresponds percentage of votes they had received.\n",
      "As a result, major parties get most of their seats from constituencies, while smaller non-regionalist parties rely on party lists. For example, in last Sunday's election CDU won 185 constituencies and 15 party list seats, with FDP 0 and 80, respectively.\n",
      "Therefore, a major party might be tempted to have no candidates run in the first list and endorse independent candidates that are close to their ideology. Assuming most voters know who is endorsed by his/her favourite party, independents in question will win their races and the major party will still win a bunch of \"compensation\" seats, since it didn't technically win any constituency race.\n",
      "Taking recent election as an example, we could have 185 CDU-leaning and -endorsed independents, but CDU would also win an insane number of party list seats (about 200, not sure about precise algorithm calculating \"compensations\"). That would easily give them majority.\n",

      "\n",
      "By far the most controversial element of the state’s technological transformation is the risk score itself. Similar assessments have popped up across the country. One ProPublica investigation found that a tool called Compas, which was used in sentencing decisions, overwhelmingly rated black defendants higher risk than white defendants.\n",
      "“An effective risk assessment must be gender and race neutral,” says Judge Caposela, one of the PSA’s early evangelists in New Jersey. “The more risk factors you have, the less likely you’ll be able to eliminate gender and racial bias.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This new software program avoids profiling by race or gender, but discriminates against age:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arnold Foundation, which designed New Jersey’s PSA tool, now used in several states and dozens of local jurisdictions, attempts to sidestep that problem by vastly limiting the number of risk factors it considers to eliminate racial or gender indicators. The Foundation analyzed 1.5 million pre-trial records from across the country and narrowed its algorithm down to look at just nine risk factors: the person’s age at the current arrest, whether the current offense is violent, ... Unlike other tools, it doesn’t weigh factors like education, income, or employment, any of which might disadvantage certain demographic groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, age is also a protected category! So why do they discriminate against age but not race or gender? Especially gender since it's well known males commit more violent acts than females.\n",

      "Original Question: What politically can be done to compel global compliance by Google?\n",
      "Full Question: It's becoming obvious that Google is rapidly being boxed in by various countries. Several years ago, the EU courts created a Right to be Forgotten, in which people in EU countries could complain to Google and have certain results about them removed... in that country's localized results (i.e. French citizens would have their unflattering data scrubbed from google.fr, not google.com or any other country). This seemed to work for a while, but France demanded all results be removed worldwide. Google has since moved to geo-located filtering while litigation with France is pending. \n",
      "This week the EU announced a $2.7B fine against Google for anti-trust violations. It's unclear what regulations Google may face in light of that. Today, the Canadian Supreme Court ordered worldwide removal of search results for a company.\n",
      "It's obvious that the global regulation genie is out of the bottle here. I expect more countries to start issuing rulings like this, mandating changes in Google's rankings. I also expect these rulings will become more intrusive (some in France want Google's algorithm made public).\n",
      "The question I have is this: if Google has nothing within these countries, or simply withdraws its physical presence, what political actions could be taken to compel Google to comply?\n",
      "Note: While this touches on legal issues, the actions to compel would have to be political in nature since the enforcement would have to be between countries. i.e. if Google were to withdraw to just its US footprint, how would the EU enforce its ruling then, since their only obvious recourse would be to block Google's website, which would be unpopular.\n",

      "Original Question: How do democracies other than the US handle changes to district maps?\n",
      "Full Question: Every representative democracy needs to have some method of dividing up territory into districts such that the people within that district can choose someone to represent their interests to the state or national government. Those same maps also need to be periodically updated to reflect demographic changes as people move around or as new people register to vote. In the U.S. this process has become deeply political, and the party in power when the maps are redrawn will try to make those maps as favorable to themselves as possible. Even in cases where they can't gain seats outright, the districts will often be drawn in such a way that they concentrate people of a particular political preference, creating 'safe' districts where the only meaningful challenge to a representative can come from their own party.\n",
      "The obvious solution would seem to be taking the process out of the hands of elected representatives, but that comes with its own problems. How do you choose the people to update the maps? Appointed positions run the risk of corruption or of simply becoming political prizes the way supreme court nominations are now. If it is a hired position (say a division of the census department) you run the risk of breeding mistrust and resentment since people tend to be suspicious of unelected bureaucrats with no oversight. Relying on a computer algorithm just shifts the problem around, someone still has to write and update the software.\n",
      "This seems like a fundamental problem, but it isn't something I have seen discussed as a hot button topic outside the U.S. How do other democratic systems handle this issue? What are the trade-offs of those solutions? Are there particular pros and cons to these alternatives that make them better suited to a particular political system? Would they still work if applied to a U.S. style system with only two major parties?\n",

      "Original Question: Does Facebook have a program that regularly checks their employees&#39; (especially their content moderator teams) political involvements?\n",
      "Full Question: Recently, here in the Philippines, there's news that Facebook took down an account/group/page of an organization named \"Hands Off Our Children\". This is an organization that fights for parents whose kids were recruited or allegedly kidnapped by militant groups (rebels, NPA, or whatever. Forgive me, I'm still new to politics and still catching up on this subject). Why would anyone remove such cause? We'll obviously it speaks against a certain political party.\n",
      "I believe these kind of things are also happening in other countries. Is there a law that mandates these social media companies to regularly examine their people and make sure they have no political involvement?\n",
      "For example, I have found a conspiracy about an FB manager that might be \"friends\" with someone on a political party (I don't have to mention names and please note this is a conspiracy). More pages, groups, and posts of one side are being deleted more than the other. Not to mention, Troll factories are playing a big role now (which could also be done as an inside job, I believe).\n",
      "One could say that the pages of a party, were deleted because of some violations. But if you play with VPN (To jump from countries to another & assuming you have knowledge to the politics of those countries), Clean your browsing cache and cookies (Attempting to make sure the feed tuning algorithm do not totally feed you according to your taste), and do some investigation yourself, you can objectively observe that the same rules do not consistently and equally apply to all. Even deleting of troll accounts doesn't seem free from bias.\n",
      "Take policing of troll accounts for example. If we were able to determine and plot on a graph the population of trolls according to their political groupings, we would probably see a huge difference across the groups. Especially if we look at the troll birth rates (creation of account) and death rates (banned/deleted).\n",

      "Original Question: Fighting for academic fairness: My authorship is unaffected but my PhD advisor pushed up authorship of a co-author at the expense of other co-authors\n",
      "Full Question: I’m Nick, a postdoc currently working on publication of my PhD work. There are several authors on the paper - two former graduate students as co-first authors (myself and Aubrey), followed by five undergraduates (all of who have graduated now) and another younger current graduate student as the last author (Pax, who overlapped with Aubrey and me during our PhD years) before the PI's name (i.e. PI is senior/corresponding author).\n",
      "We are preparing a submission to a journal after three failed submissions.\n",
      "In this version, our advisor moved up the position of Pax to be second author, after myself and Aubrey. We only noticed from looking at the manuscript version she sent to us with comments. In other words, she didn't discuss the change with us.\n",
      "After several days of contemplation and looking through the manuscript to see if Pax really added so much to the changes in the manuscript, both Aubrey and I decided that Pax didn’t deserve to be second author - and the answer is pretty obvious because all the remaining authors contributed intellectually and experimentally to the paper. Pax, on the other hand, has never added much to manuscript meetings and doesn’t know the data from the paper as well either. Despite that, my advisor decided to move up the position of Pax to be second author.\n",
      "When we questioned my advisor on this, she said that Pax contributed intellectually to the current layout of the paper (which didn’t change significantly from the last version) and gave another unconvincing answer about how intellectual contribution is difficult to assess (which in this case, I feel the answer is pretty black and white).\n",
      "Aubrey and I really think there is a hidden reason that my PI is unwilling to admit, but what bothers us is that our PI is being non-transparent. I figured this is academia and the PI gets the final say in what she does.\n",
      "Neither my or Aubrey’s authorship position is affected. But I know that since I am the first author on this paper, I can fight for the authorship positions of undergraduate authors all of who have really contributed a significant amount of work to the paper. This way I can learn to fight for fairness within academia.\n",

      "Original Question: Adjust grading policy mid-course to improve attendance?\n",
      "Full Question: I'm teaching a math course and have traditionally not enforced attendance, instead allocating 5% of the course grade to in-class participation (questions and answers), which maintained satisfactory attendance levels. However, this semester, I eliminated the participation points to simplify grading, resulting in significantly lower attendance, possibly exacerbated by the class's early start time at 8:30 AM.\n",
      "Given we're two-thirds through the semester, I'm contemplating reintroducing participation points to boost attendance but am concerned about the fairness and implications of changing the grading policy mid-course.\n",
      "How should I navigate this situation? Is it advisable to alter the grading scheme now, or are there alternative strategies to encourage attendance without compromising fairness?\n",

      "Original Question: Fair use: Instructor sharing notes from textbooks\n",
      "Full Question: I am a new instructor, planning a course; this post comes from good faith. Basically, I am designing a course and am trying to give my students the best learning outcomes without demanding that they spend too much on textbooks. \n",
      "1) There is one main textbook that I want to assign: Textbook A. From textbook A, I want to make my own detailed notes (certainly not word for word) so that my students can mostly read the notes to learn. From the student's perspective, the textbook is mostly for occasional reference and for the homework exercises. If I list this book on the syllabus and \"demand\" that students buy it, am I free to write my own notes without dropping a citation every other line? Can I post these on the course web page online?\n",
      "2) There is another book, Textbook B, that I like a lot. Due to the fact that I don't want my students to pay an absurdly high fee for two textbooks, I do not wish to demand that my students buy it. However, I do want to occasionally reference it for my own purposes. Is it sufficient to list it on the syllabus as a book that I am referencing, but explicitly state that it is not required for purchase? Again, the plan would not be word for word copying or anything -- just for some ideas, possibly even coming up with reworded versions of homework or exam questions, etc.\n",
      "I am torn on these questions. A part of me feels like I could do something wrong, but I also know the copyright laws seem to be pretty relaxed when it comes to teaching.\n",
      "The \"treat others the way you want to be treated\" rule makes me believe that ethically, textbook A is fine, and textbook B is fine as long as I (a) do not use it that much and (b) reference it for any notably clever ideas.\n",
      "EDIT: To add to questions above: Say Book B has many real world examples (with citations within the questions). One of the main reasons why I like the book is the abundance of real world problems. But I like the flow of text A more for teaching. I would like to give many of the examples from book B, but again, I don't want my students to pay an absurd amount for a book that I am only taking questions from. How do I settle this? I certainly can't reword the problems using the original citations given in book B.\n",
      "In summary: Like the flow of book A more, but like many of the real world questions in B. What would you recommend in order to reduce textbook costs?\n",

      "Original Question: Is it fair to desk-reject a manuscript because it breaks relativity?\n",
      "Full Question: Every so often a journal I edit receives papers with some kind of claim that, if true, would break mainstream physics. For example, a paper could claim that waves in dark matter can travel at v ~ 1014 m/s.\n",
      "Because relativity has met every experimental test we've thrown at it, and because relativity has a hard limit on velocities at the speed of light (3×108 m/s), any paper making this kind of claim is immediately suspect. One doesn't need to know what else is in the paper to be pretty confident it is wrong.\n",
      "However, it is also known that relativity is an incomplete theory because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. It's conceivable that whatever theory eventually supplants these two theories could allow velocities greater than the speed of light.\n",
      "Question: Is it fair to desk-reject the above paper based solely on this one sentence? Like, there's a 99.99% chance (maybe even higher) that the paper is wrong, but there's still a nonzero chance it could be correct. If it is unfair, what else do I need before it becomes fair to desk-reject?\n",

      "In machine learning, a given algorithm is said to be fair, or to have\n",
      "  fairness if its results are independent of some variables we consider\n",
      "  to be sensitive and not related to it (f.e.: gender, ethnicity,\n",
      "  sexual orientation, etc.).\n",

      "  characteristics, such as, gender, race, religion, physical ability,\n",
      "  and sexual orientation\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other resources, like Google in the ML Fairness limit the fairness to these aforementioned categories and no other categories are considered. \n",
      "But fairness is a lot broader context than simply these few categories mentioned here, you could easily add another few like IQ, height, beauty anything that could have a real impact on your credit score, school application or job application. Some of these categories may not be popular in existing datasets nowadays but given the exponential growth of data, they will be soon, to the extent, that we will have an abundance of data about every individual with all their physical and mental categories mapped into the datasets.\n",
      "Then the question would be how to define fairness given all these categories presented in the datasets. And will it even be possible to define fairness if all physical and mental dimensions are considered as it seems that when we do so, all our weights in, say, the neural nets should be exactly the same, i.e., giving no discriminator in any way or form towards or against any physical or mental category of a human being? That means that a machine learning system that is fair across all possible dimensions will have no way of distinguishing one human being from another which would render these machine learning models useless. \n",
      "To wrap it up, while it does make perfect sense to withdraw bias towards any individual given the categories like gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc., the set is not closed and with the increasing number of categories being added to this set, we will inevitably arrive at a point where no discrimination (in a statistical sense) would be possible. \n",
      "And that's why my question, are fair machine learning models possible?\n",
      "Or perhaps, the only possible fair machine learning models are those that arbitrarily include some categories but ignore other categories which, of course, if far from being fair.\n",

      "Original Question: How should I compare multiple machine learning models to be (generally) fair to all models?\n",
      "Full Question: I am testing multiple models on IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (1470 lines) and HR Analytics dataset (15000 lines) for a research project. The models include traditional models (Naive Bayes, SVM), tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost), and recently-developed deep models (TabNet, FTTransformer).\n",
      "Since there are many models, the first strategy I thought of to compare multiple models (to be fair for them) is to use the default hyperparameters (set by all the corresponding libraries) for all those models. But the performance on the first dataset is not good (as expected when using the default), so I need to tune hyperparameters in those models. The problem here is that different models have different types of hyperparameters, and I don't know if a fair strategy exists to fine-tune and compare the models?\n",

The cleaner's actions are Suck, Left, and Right and it can't go out of the rectangle and the squares are either empty or dirty. I know this is an amateur question but how does randomization (for instance flipping a fair coin) avoid entering the infinite loop? Aren't we entering such a loop If the result of the toss is heads in odd tosses and tails in even tosses?\n",

Such an agent has just two possible percepts: [Dirty] and [Clean]. It can Suck in response to [Dirty]; what should it do in response to [Clean]? Moving Left fails (forever) if it happens to start in square\n",
      "A, and moving Right fails (forever) if it happens to start in square B. Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. Escape from infinite loops is possible if the agent can randomize its actions. For example, if the vacuum agent perceives [Clean], it might flip a coin to choose between Right and Left. It is easy to show that the agent will reach the other square in an average of two steps. Then, if that square is dirty, the agent will clean it and the task will be complete. Hence, a randomized simple reflex agent might outperform a deterministic simple reflex agent.\n",

I wonder how you keep up with the current state of the art and latest developments? The field is progressing very fast, models that were considered SOTA not even a decade ago are now (almost) outdated (Attention Is All You Need). A lot of this progress is driven by big tech companies (source), e.g. 12% of all papers accepted at NeurIPS 2019 have at least one author from Google and DeepMind (source).\n",
      "My strategy is to read blogs and articles to maintain a general overview and not to miss any important breakthroughs. To be up to date in subfields of my own interest, I read specific papers once in a while. What are your personal strategies? Continuous education is a big keyword here. It's not about understanding every detail and being able to reproduce results, but rather maintaining a bird's eye view, having an idea about the direction of research and knowing whats already possible.\n",
      "To name a few of my preferred sources there are the research blogs of the big players: OpenAI, DeepMind, Google AI, FAIR. Further there are very good personal blogs with a more educational character, like the well known one of Christopher Olah, the recently started one of Yoshua Bengio and the one from Jay Alammar. Unfortunately finding personal blogs is hard, it often depends on luck and referrals, also the update frequency is generally lower since these people have (understandably) other important things to do in life as well.\n",

I train the model with one cohort and I use another cohort for testing. And I want to evaluate fairness in gender for this disease. My first idea was to downsample the test to have the same number of participants with the disease than healthy. But our discussion takes place because the testing cannot be touched. But this is clear in diagnosis and prediction but not for fairness. Some papers srratify by groups. If I use the full cohort most of the cases are healthy women (negative and sensitive group) in a ratio e.g., of 7.000 vs 100 so the fairness is most showing the bias for the healthy women than what i am more interested women with disease and this is not what i want. I wonder if someone thought about this issue. Fairness is a new issue and i do not see it clearly to treat it as prediction or classification. I think testing should be stratified somehow for not having those imbalance ratios between healthy and non-healthy.\n",

It seems that this is doing average pooling over the word tokens to get a sentence vector, but we never suggested that this will generate meaningful sentence representations. And even if they are decent representations when fed into a DNN trained for a downstream task, it doesn't mean that they will be meaningful in terms of cosine distance.

Seems pretty clear it's over-fitting and thus, not viable.\n",
      "Hashing, for whatever reason, will not apply to one of the columns, but I suppose it could still be viable. I just need to figure out why it's not hashing all of my features (I suppose this would be suited best for a separate question?)\n",

      "Unfair for C, as it has more possibilities to make mistakes. Probably this could be somehow compensated? E.g. if it recognizes a class which is not in A, just the next best is taken (until the correct class is predicted or a wrong class from A is preditected)\n",

Instead, we need to manually specify an order, right? However, if we do not have domain knowledge, how can we specify the order? Also a manual way is usually prone to error.

      "I believe this falls under the context of consumer rights. Its regarding downloadable games and software legitimately purchased through a vendor that turn out to have regionally geolocked licensing, preventing their installation which is not conveyed at the time of purchase.\n",
      "The players:\n",
      "We have the company who owns the platform and the online store where the product is purchased from.  We have the purchaser in one region of the world and the receiving party in another. Both the purchaser and receiving party are members of or subscribed to the same platform and their services.\n",
      "The scenario:\n",
      "A digitally downloadable application is legitimately purchased through the platform's store, \"Buy as gift\" feature by the purchaser. Once the purchase is confirmed and processed, the licensing keys are immediately sent by the system to the receiving party which they can then use to redeem the item.  \n",

Once the purchaser is made aware of the geolocked licensing issue, they promptly submit a request through the platform for an immediate refund and wait for up to 72 hours.\n",
      "When they receive response, the request has been declined on the basis that the product has either been redeemed or used, which of course, it has not since it couldn't be installed by the receiving party as a result of the regionally geolocked licensing.\n",
      "Now the inquiry:\n",
      "Who should be responsible? Should the purchaser (consumer) have the expectation of a refund on the basis that they were not made aware of the geolocked licensing and potential issues ahead of the purchase? \n",

A few hypothetical examples would be a company claiming its products are designed using a statistical formula to guarantee performance or a competitive pay to play mobile gaming app guaranteeing fairness. Are they required to provide proof to substantiate those claims, such as the mathematical equation used or disclose how fairness is actually determined, or are they allowed to make frivolous guarantees without ever needing to back up their claims? \n",

      "Original Question: Fair Use and DMCA\n",
      "Full Question: My project (EditVideoBot) is an automated 'Twitter bot' program that allows users to edit videos within Twitter (they can add music to the video, or their own text, etc). My first account I ran this project on was suspended at 31,000 followers after being pursued by UMG and Sony with their DMCA complaints, regarding music that my program added to some videos.\n",
      "I'm just a 15 year old student developer, but I'm looking to find out what I can do in order to prevent things like this from happening. It seems that everything I've tried hasn't worked.\n",
      "I should also note that this isn't a commercial project, it's just a hobby of mine.\n",
      "Here's what I've tried so far:\n",
      "\n",
      "Submitting DMCA counter-notices to Twitter\n",
      "\n",
      "In these counter notices, I've given all the required statements, as well as extra detail into their Fair Use Policy, explaining that my program is compliant with all the points detailed at that link.\n",
      "Twitter says the following in their emails when they confirm they've received my counter-notice and forwarded it to the complainant:\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don’t receive a notice from the complainant within 10 business days, we’ll cease withholding the material. The complainant’s notice must confirm that they’ve sought a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to content on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every case where I've received this email, I have never received a further notice from the complainant, but Twitter never ceased withholding the material after 10 business days either. I receive no further communications from both Twitter and the complainant.\n",
      "There's no proper formal way for me to directly contact Twitter that I know of - communication is basically one-way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Contacting the complainant directly\n",
      "\n",
      "This turned out very bad. Not only did I receive no reply back from them, they then appeared to increase the number of DMCA complaints my account got. I was receiving at least 5 complaints a day from then on - way faster than I could counter them.\n",
      "Within a matter of days after contacting them, my account was just automatically suspended by Twitter - no way to counter it, nothing. I tried submitting counter-notices after my account's suspension, but I never even received a single email back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I have 2 questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Am I in the right here? I clearly have no commercial or malicious intent to violate copyright laws. The material uploaded by the program is very short and insubstantial. Everything it uploads has zero impact on the original work's value.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What further action can I take in order to prevent this from happening in the future (and perhaps get my original account back)?\n",
      "I've just added a feature that automatically processes the audio to check if it contains proper music, and then gives credit to the record label it belongs to. Would that help in mitigating further complaints?\n",
      "AFAIK, Fair Use isn't a law, so I'm not sure I can counter the takedowns based on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What else can I do? It's pretty crappy that they're trying to ruin someone's fun hobby while actual PIRACY is so rampant. There has to be something I can do.\n",
      "I appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance!\n",
      "Edit:\n",
      "I don't see why my program would be considered a 'piracy tool' when a program such as youtube-dl (which is in fact the tool my program utilises in order to download music) is able to successfully be reinstated after a DMCA complaint from the RIAA.\n",
      "Doesn't that program enable users to download copyrighted material from YouTube and other sites? Just because a tool could potentially be used to violate the DMCA, does that mean it can get taken down? Not in youtube-dl's case, and I don't see a difference with mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How could anything helping users to add music not be used to facilitate adding without consent?\n",
      "\n",
      "I like what @josh3736 referenced (from the Betamax case) and I think it's a good response:\n",
      "\n",
      "the business of supplying the equipment that makes such copying feasible should not be stifled simply because the equipment is used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions of respondents' works....\n",
      "\n",
      "EditVideoBot is an automated program that automatically edits videos based on commands provided by other Twitter users that mention the account - I am providing the service, other people operate and produce the material with it. I don't see why I need to take the fall.\n",
      "Is my program not just one that provides a video editing service? It's purpose is not to infringe on any laws.\n",

      "Original Question: How to determine a fair sentence?\n",
      "Full Question: I am reading a book called Noise, I am still at the beginning, but already I have a question. The book in the first chapter tells the story of how the US Sentencing Commission tried to set some guidelines for the criminal sentences. By their own admission they did not have a method to determine a fair sentence and their solution was to take an average of past sentences. I thought that such solution was too simplistic and I wondered whether there could be a better way.\n",
      "One solution could be to study the outcome of past convictions. Someone could take some past cases where the convict has served the entire sentence at least x years ago, group these cases by type of crime, circumstances and the length of the sentence (maybe discretised) count the number of convictions in each group and calculate the percentage of repeated offenders. I guess that, barring some noise, it could be possible to fit a curve to these data that would see the number of repeated offenders inversely proportional to the length of the sentence. In many case a change in the slope of the curve could indicate point that would optimise the trade off between the length of the sentence and the number of repeated offenders.\n",
      "Did anybody ever make a similar study to determine what could be a fair sentence? I am not a law expert and I am sure that there could be other methods that are a lot more sophisticated, but this seems a step ahead compared to the solution adopted by the Sentencing Commission. Am I right or is there a flaw in this idea?\n",

      "Full Question: Good day. I currently work in the publishing field, but have a unique inquiry regarding fair use related to copyright law; I am interested in launching an executive summary service to assist busy clinicians who need quality summaries of the medical literature -- journal articles, etc. -- some under copyright law, some from open-access journals/Creative Commons, and some from pre-press repositories, etc. I would be charging subscriptions for my summary services, and I need a better understanding of whether I need explicit licenses from the publishers to be able to stay on the proper side of copyright law. I see a number of services in the marketplace which summarize business books or self-help books, but my research hasn't been able to uncover how they are able to proceed without triggering legal action on the part of publishers. Or are summaries of medical journal articles covered under Fair Use? Thanks!\n",

      "Post URL: https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/65067/reconciling-utilitarianism-and-rawlss-theory-of-justice-as-fairness\n",
      "Original Question: Reconciling Utilitarianism and Rawls&#39;s Theory of Justice as Fairness\n",
      "Full Question: I will argue that John Stuart Mill's greatest happiness principle (GHP) should be revised to avoid problematic implications and to better fit humans' intuitive sense of morality.  Furthermore, the resulting revised version of GHP is actually quantitatively (and thus qualitatively) equivalent to Rawls's theory of justice as fairness.\n",
      "My question: did anyone make this argument or a similar one reconciling utilitarianism and Rawlsianism (if that's what you call it)?  Also, am I misinterpreting Mill's or Rawls's theories or making mistakes in my reasoning?\n",
      "Sorry for how long this turned out (it seemed a lot shorter in my head).\n",
      "John Stuart Mill's greatest happiness principle (GHP) states that \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote [the indiscriminate sum total of individual] happiness.\"  While Mill does not explicitly state the bracketed bit in his description of GHP, he and his followers seem to assume it in their application of GHP.  However, his argument does not justify that bracketed bit, and I will argue that it is actually the source of many of utilitarianism's problems.  I will revise GHP to deal with these problems and come up with a BHP, or best happiness principle.\n",
      "Problem 1: inequality is bad, but Mill's GHP does not seem to take that into account.  Indeed, when allocating happiness in a society of 10 people, Mill would be indifferent between giving 1 person 11 units and 1 unit each to the other 9, and giving everyone 2 units (they come out to the same sum).  Intuitively, this is wrong; we feel that a more equal society is better, ceteris paribus.  So how do we adjust this?  We employ the principle of marginal utility.  If one person is already very happy, giving them another unit of happiness should not be as valuable as giving a very sad person happiness (intuitively, it is more morally valuable to cheer someone up when they are sad than it is to stoke a happy person's ego).  (A classic example of diminishing marginal utility: it is more valuable to give a starving person some food than to give that food to someone who has just eaten their fill at an all-you-can-eat buffet.)  Therefore, we can apply a utility function to the happiness of each person in the society with this in mind (making it increasing with a diminishing slope), such as the square root (sqrt) function.  We sum up all of the utilities.  We should then square the total to get back to happiness units.  When we apply this to our previous example, we have (sqrt(12)+9)^2=155.35 for the unequal society and (sqrt(2)*10)^2=200 for the equal society.  Thus, we have accounted for the immorality of inequality.\n",
      "Another problem we run into with utilitarianism is when we apply it to situations of changing the population size.  Is it better to let overpopulation run wild, exhausting the earth's resources and making everyone else slightly less happy?  Original GHP as well as our current modification of GHP would say yes; the sum total of happiness would be increasing.  This is intuitively wrong, however.  It seems that we want to maximize people's quality of lives (or the average happiness), rather than the sum total of happiness.  GHP (in its original form and in our modified form) yields the “repugnant conclusion” that a very large society of miserable beings is better than a small society of happy beings (Parfit).  Thus we can improve on our above modification of GHP by taking the average of the sum of the utilities of each person's happiness (getting the average utility), and then squaring that to convert to happiness units (this is analogous to going from total utilitarianism to average utilitarianism).  If we let h_i be the happiness of the ith person in the world (assuming everyone in the world is numbered), where i is between 1 and p (p being the total number of people in the world), we are maximizing for: ((sum from i=1 to p of sqrt(h_i))/p)^2.  I'll refer to the principle that humans should aim to maximize this quantity as the best happiness principle (BHP).\n",
      "There are two other comments (not necessarily modifications, but rather corrections of anticipated misinterpretations) I should make on this principle.  First, one objector might say that BHP has the repugnant conclusion that we would want to kill people who are less sad than average.  This is certainly not true; killing anyone would violate their rights (which exist because human rights are necessary for human happiness, as Mill points out).  Another way to look at it: killing someone for this reason would cause everyone else to become terrified that they or their loved ones would be next on the utilitarian chopping block, significantly reducing inequality-adjusted average happiness and violating BHP.  So this is not actually a sound objection to BHP.  Another objector might say that BHP would have the repugnant conclusion that a society in which one person would have infinite happiness and everyone else is as sad as can be would always be better than a society in which everyone had some happiness.  This ridiculousness of this objection stems from the fact that no one can be infinitely happy.  There is a limit to how much happiness one person can have.  So this is also not a sound objection.  One last possible objection: BHP doesn't take into account the moral value of nature.  It actually does; killing animals or harming nature would be immoral because animals and nature make humans happy.  One might criticize this as too anthropocentric, as it bases the value of nature in terms of how it makes humans feel.  This may be a fair point, but I will fight back by pointing out that I, for one, would have no problem seeing mosquitoes eliminated from the earth, if it weren't the case that such an extinction would hugely disrupt many ecosystems.  Lastly: I do not intend BHP to be a rule-of-thumb for people to use in their everyday lives (it seems unlikely that someone could make each of their decisions to maximize inequality-adjusted average happiness).  Rather, it should be a general goal for humans as a whole, which we should take into account in the design of social institutions (stay tuned), as well as secondary moral principles.\n",
      "Now, let's consider Rawls's 'original position,' the societal staging ground where people haven't yet discovered their natural resources/attributes (intellect, work-ethic, race, gender, etc.).  All people in the OP are rational and mutually disinterested (as he puts it).  We want to structure society such that these people would want to be in our version of society as much as possible.  That way, although people cannot consent to entering our society as babies, we have the next best thing: ensuring that, if babies could decide whether or not to enter our society as rational beings, they would do so (because there would be no different structure of society that they would prefer).  Rawls is assuming that an optimal society is always preferable to having no society (I think this is a safe assumption to make in our modern world).  Assuming that any given member of the OP ultimately wants to maximize their own happiness (since they are mutually disinterested), how should we structure society such that they will want to be in the society as much as possible?  One might say that we should maximize the expected value of happiness (this is equivalent to the average happiness, since our OP member has 1/p chance of being any particular person in the society, so the expected value is the sum of each individual's happiness all divided by p).  If we did so, their expected situation would be as good as possible.  However, as decision theorists would attest to, expected value is not all that matters in evaluating a probabilistic situation.  Due to the diminishing marginal utility of goods, people are generally risk-averse in such situations.  I will not justify this beyond saying that it is well supported by decision theory and empirical data.  Thus, a rational member of the OP would not want to maximize the expected value of their happiness in the society, they would want to maximize the certainty equivalent of their happiness in the society.  The certainty equivalent of a probabilistic situation is the amount of the good in question such that the actor would be indifferent between taking that amount with 100% certainty and going through with the probabilistic situation.  For example, if someone with a sqrt utility function was offered a 100$/hr salary if a flipped coin landed heads and 0$/hr if tails, the certainty equivalent would be (sqrt(10)/2+sqrt(0)/2)^2=25.  This is lower than the expected value of 50$ (by 25$) because this person would be willing to pay to mitigate the risk of having to work for no salary (this concept explains how insurance companies make money).  You might see where this is going.  Our OP member would want to maximize the certainty equivalent of their happiness in the society, which can be expressed as: ((sum from i=1 to p of (1/p)*sqrt(h_i)))^2=((sum from i=1 to p of sqrt(h_i))/p)^2, which is the same quantity as that which BHP states should be maximized.  And thus our modified utilitarian theory is reconciled with Rawls's concept of the original position.\n",

Suppose that to treat these people with fairness and decency—refusing to lie to them, obeying the law in regard to them, refusing to cheat or steal from them—increases the amount of wealth and power they wield, and therefore increases the amount of harm they may cause.

      "N can be as large as we want it.\n",
      "Similar means that the probabilities of heads have same value, ie p_1=p_2=..=p_N=p. Fair means p=1/2.\n",

      "According to mathematical literature the two experiments are identical. In fact the first experiment is always reduced to the second, which is the one used to model the event space.\n",

      "In the first experiment, throwing the same coin N times and getting an outcome of all heads is increasingly problematic for the same fair coin.\n",
      "Whereas for the second experiment, getting an outcome of all heads, is not problematic for any coin, simply thrown once, thus not problematic for the whole outcome.\n",
      "If we say that the first experiment is the same in this sense, that N throws is simply a series of one throw, then either throwing N times looses meaning, or by same token as point 2) we have no reason to infer the coin is not fair by observing any long sequence of heads, which seems paradoxical.\n",
      "If the sequence is all that matters and not the coins themselves, then we can infer in second experiment that all coins are not fair, simply by one throw of each, which seems paradoxical.\n",
      "if the sequence is all that matters and different coins can really be anywhere at anytime simply thrown once, this raises questions how the different coins are synchronized so that the sequence satisfies certain statistical properties which are similar to those of one and same coin which seems paradoxical, whereas the same questions are not necessarily raised for one and the same coin.\n",

There is a piece of evidence supporting the charge; he is, after all, plying baseball... but in so choosing Rawls is claiming neither that baseball is superior for all purposes to football nor that this purpose [hand-eye coordination involved with baseball] is superior to any other.\n",
      "I think Neal misses the point. Me choosing to play baseball is trivial and does not contain a normative implication. But, if I choose to eat vegan, that is of a fundamentally different category. In doing so I am also rejecting non-veganism. Rawls's Justice as Fairness (or any other political theory, necessarily) seems to be in the same camp as veganism. That is, it seems to be of a different order. Any theory of justice implies a rejection of not-that-theory-of-justice. My question is what philosophic inquiry deals with why this seems to be the case (or perhaps why it doesn't).\n",

      "Original Question: &quot;Reality is a social construct&quot; -- fair characterization or not?\n",
      "Full Question: This is something else I've wondered about. There seem to be these fierce online debates and movements that center around various questions of the validity of so called \"social justice\" issues which are full of lots of emotive stuff from both sides pro and con (e.g. terms like \"man/white/cis/whatever 'splaining'\" and \"SJWs\" are thrown against the opposing 'sides' respectively from pro and con sides against con and pro sides). One of the central pieces of this argumentation seems to hinge around this notion of this alleged philosophical idea that \"reality is a social construct\" against \"reality is objective\". But the thing is, reading it, I wonder if the various partisans involved really do or do not understand exactly what they are bandying about in these heated arguments.\n",
      "In particular, the \"reality is a social construct\" is attributed variously to the \"left\", \"academic left\", \"Cultural Marxism\" but also \"postmodernism\". The first two terms seem like political charges, the third seems like a weird slur, but the fourth is a legitimate philosophical reference. Also perhaps \"social theory\" or \"critical theory\" is indicted with as being \"guilty\" of this \"bad\" philosophical \"notion\".\n",
      "But the question is, is that a truly fair characterization, and if so, what exactly does it mean? Because to me, if you take it absolutely literally, it cannot be true, for a very simple reason: I cannot sign an agreement with someone that will magically make gold appear by miracle in my room by both of us agreeing that that gold now exists in the room. If reality behaved this way, it would seem a lot of politicking and wars would be easily resolved: we could just \"legislate\" or \"social construct\" literally every resource we wanted into existence. Yet I would find it hard to imagine this argument would have escaped notice of everyone who has argued what is construed as \"reality is a social construct\". So thus I'd like to know, what does that phrase actually mean in regard to what it's actually referring to by any serious thinker and not merely some random joe-blow with an opinion on the internet and an ax to grind (of either partisan persuasion), is it even a fair characterization at all, and if so, how is the above argument answered and dismissed?\n",

      "Original Question: Maximizing expected value - &quot;triple or nothing&quot; on a fair bet\n",
      "Full Question: The \"triple-or-nothing paradox\" is that a game where I expect to increase my money (on average) at each stage ends up bankrupting me with probability 1 if I play long enough. However, the paradox seems to have an easy resolution, in the sense that a rational actor could decide that a 50% risk of losing your entire stake on each round is simply too high.\n",
      "A slight modification removes the \"easy way out\" for this rational actor: I stake an initial wager W to play this game. At each coin flip, I either lose 75% of my current stake, or gain 125% of my current stake, with 50-50 probability. Any individual round of this game is quite attractive to a bettor, for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "at every wager, the amount the bettor stands to win is bigger than the amount they stand to lose\n",
      "\n",
      "the bettor never loses their entire stake (if we consider continuous quantities of money) and thus can always make a comeback\n",
      "\n",
      "the bettor's expected value of their wager is 1/2 (125% - 75%) = 25% gain\n",
      "\n",
      "expected value after n rounds is (1.25)^n of initial stake -- the bettor's expectation increases exponentially\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At each round, the bettor has to choose between playing again and cashing out. The arguments above seem to favor playing again for any individual round. Yet over time, the bettor's wealth approaches 0 with probability 1: because it multiplies by 2.25 on wins, but divides by 4 on losses, more than 1 win is required to balance out a loss. Since the flips are fair, this means the bettor's wealth is multiplied on average by (2.25)/4 = 9/16 = 56.25% for every 2 rounds, which translates to a 3/4 = 75% multiplier per round on average. In other words, the bettor's actual wealth (as opposed to their expected wealth) multiplies by about 0.75 on each round, hence approaches 0 for large numbers of rounds.\n",
      "The paradox is then that during the game, the bettor always has a reason to play the next round in terms of expectation. It is always irrational for them to stop playing after any particular round. Thus, a rational actor will decide to continue playing forever, whereupon their initial stake dwindles to zero with probability 1. How is it that making the most rational decision at each stage (whether one is currently winning or losing) leads to going broke?\n",
      "Edit: Some commenters have attempted to resolve the paradox by appealing to an individual’s utility differing from the strict monetary payoffs. However, this attempted resolution utterly fails: if we know an individual’s utilities, we can always set up a version of this paradox that applies to them specifically. They “stake” something worth a certain amount of utility to them, and at each stage of the game, either lose 75% of the utility value of their current stake, or gain 125% of the utility value of their current stake. Once the game has been adjusted to their utility preferences, they face the same paradox as before. The presentation in terms of monetary value is for expositional purposes only and in no way fundamental to the paradox itself.\n",

      "Original Question: Are the differences between capitalism&#39;s and socialism&#39;s analysis of resource distribution fairness fundamental?\n",
      "Full Question: I have always understood a (broadly speaking) capitalist, free market approach to economics to rest on the notion that a resource distribution is fair in light of how closely it correlates the resources an individual or firm receives to the value they contribute to the market.  This value might be apparent and concrete, such as a good, service, loan, land utilization, labor, etc., or abstract, such as human attention, a vivid vision of a firm's future operations and role in the economy, liquidity, etc.\n",
      "On the flip side, I have understood a (broadly speaking) socialist approach to economics to rest on the notion that a resource distribution is fair in light of how closely it correlates the resources an individual or firm receives to his/her/its need for such resources.  For example, August Becker described \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" as \"the basic principle of communism.\"\n",
      "However, in order to ground normative claims related to the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction, perhaps most notably the claim that the hierarchies they form and occupy in a capitalist economy are fundamentally unjust, socialists seem to make frequent use of the former notion of fairness, perhaps merely failing to recognize some of the categories listed above as legitimate value (claiming that CEOs, landlords, securities traders, etc., \"contribute nothing to society\"), but generally recognizing at least labor, goods, and services as legitimate things to correlate to the acquisition of economic resources.  Whether or not you think this is a narrow minded analysis of what contributes to society, at the least it is an attempt to correlate resource distribution with contribution to society, as opposed to with need.  Thus I am confused as to what notion of fairness a socialist economic theory actually rests upon.\n",
      "Obviously, pretty much everyone agrees that a fair resource distribution is not automatically a good resource distribution.  No one getting any resources is presumably fair, but not very good.  The goodness of a resource distribution is thus a multivariable function of its fairness and some other consideration(s).\n",
      "Does the socialist fundamentally disagree with the capitalist about what constitutes a fair resource distribution, or is the foundational notion of fairness agreed upon, with the socialist merely giving less weight than the capitalist to fairness relative to the other considerations that factor into crafting a viable resource distribution model?\n",

      "Original Question: Has the abolishment of the FCC fairness doctrine led to political polarization in the US?\n",
      "Full Question: From after World War II the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforced as policy (fairness doctrine), which required broadcasters to discuss controversial matters of public interest and give contrasting views on the matter. For example in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC the supreme court ruled that the FCC could require broadcasters to give individuals free air time to respond to personal on-air attacks.\n",

      "Full Question: Recently, there is a lengthy discussion about HR392 (fairness for skilled immigrant workers) in the US house and senate. It means if this bill will be passed by the house and senate, the limitation of green card for immigrants based on their birth country will be lifted and whoever came first to the US will be served first. As a result, due to huge backlog of Indian and Chinese immigrants waiting for their green card, it will take 10 years for other foreign citizens to be able to apply for adjustment of status. \n",

      "Full Question: The Fair Representation Act was recently introduced by House Member Don Bayer. The main changes that I've read about were that it would introduce instant-runoff style ranked choice voting and that it would put districting in the hands of an independent commission that would create much larger districts with multiple representatives versus single representative districts that currently exist. \n",

      "Full Question: It's common to hear about \"free and fair elections\" (e.g. recently with Kenyan elections). In many elections there are international observers, which are suppose to judge whether elections were \"free and fair\". But what is free and fair supposed to mean?\n",

Arguments in favor of equity can be found in a variety of policy areas such as education, medicine, law enforcement, and others.\n",
      "I'm not sure I could completely define equity, but it seems to me that it is a notion of fairness that recognizes that each person (or entity) has a different background. So it's different from equality (a kind of fairness where everyone is given identical treatment) in that it recognizes that in some cases fairness requires treating people differently.\n",

When can there be any basis at all for complaints – by courts, or journalists, or pundits – to the fairness of political districts? What would districts be like if they were fair? We can (apparently) always say that current political districts will produce Result A, and if we redistrict in a certain way it will produce Result B.

      "Full Question: The scenario is this: a lower income person in an inexpensive automobile crashes into and totals a $200,000 Ferrari. The lower income person is at fault and doesn't have insurance and thus is bankrupted by paying for repairs on the Ferrari. Even if the person does have insurance, their insurer has to pay a huge amount in repairs and thus everyone's insurance has to be more expensive to \"price in\" these kinds of situations. It strikes me as at least plausible under certain political views of fairness that everyday people shouldn't have to pay extra in insurance or take on extra financial risk to drive on publicly funded roads just because other people choose to drive extraordinarily expensive cars.\n",
      "One remedy would be to declare that if a car incurs more than say $50,000 in damages, then the person at fault (and their insurer) is only liable for $50,000 in damages.

The idea is to train multiple binary classification networks, one for each image class, and then to merge their outputs. The output layer of the merged model should be a vector of N+1 elements, where N is the number of image classes. The argmax of the output vector is the classification result (image class). The first element of the output vector is a bias term that is only activated if the image fits in none of the classes with high probability. This element is going to have a constant (bias) value in the output vector, which will serve as a  classification confidence threshold.\n",

      "Original Question: The understandability bias\n",
      "Full Question: I am a PhD student. I feel like I am increasingly experiencing situations where ideas that are explained in a way everyone can understand them are criticized as being too simple to be a major contribution to the field. I feel like people rationalize that if they can fully understand the idea then it is too elementary to be important. For simplicity I will refer to this as the understandability bias. There are obviously many ways to game this (a.k.a. baffling with B.S.) but I want to believe this does not work in the larger academic community and is more local to my experience. How much have any of you out there had similar experiences? Are there things that can be done to cater to the understandability bias without compromising your integrity? Is my sense of integrity unfounded? I promise I am not trying to simply rant and am earnestly looking for people's opinions and experiences. Thank you!\n",

      "Original Question: Channeling bias in social science / epidemiological research?\n",
      "Full Question: Has anyone seen \"channeling bias\" in the context of epidemiological research? I'm working on a manuscript describing analysis of a workplace-based, non-medical occupational health intervention using observational survey data. The intervention is treated as an exposure and is not randomly allocated. I recently discovered the pharmacological research term \"channeling bias\", where individuals most in need of treatment are more likely to receive it, usually in a trial setting. This could result in the treatment's observed effects being smaller than they actually are, since sicker individuals have a lower baseline. Participants may also be channeled if researchers think they will receive greater benefit, and thus inflate observed effects. With a workplace-based intervention, I suspect employers may be frugal and, the healthier the worker is, the less likely they are to provide the intervention (despite the intervention being mandatory), thus biasing the exposure group to be in worse shape than those without the exposure.\n",
      "I think the term channeling bias would apply well to epidemiological research, but have not seen it used in this context. Are there any reasons why it would be inappropriate? Note, I only discovered the term when reviewing a doctoral student's thesis in pharmacology, in which the student used \"healthy worker bias\" to describe this phenomenon, which sounded the opposite of what they meant, and looked into what the term would actually be. Could its use only/primarily in pharmacological research just be the result of siloing across disciplines?\n",

I'm assessing bias in the studies, following the Cochrane tool for critical appraisal, and noticed that many of the protocols do not describe random allocation of treatments. Furthermore, the Cochrane tool is specifically developed for RCTs, and a few of the questions feel only loosely applicable to the specific conditions of in vitro studies. As far as I know, there's no critical appraisal tool specifically developed for in vitro studies of cells, only human or animal studies.\n",
      "I'm probably getting caught in the weeds here, but I have a few questions. Would random allocation of treatment vs no treatment potentially harm validity, if all the cells come from the same cell line and are essentially identical?

      "We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author – a Nobel laureate – and by a relatively unknown author – an early-career research associate -, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author’s name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author’s name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend “reject” when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown.\n",

      "Original Question: How do academics control their own biases?\n",
      "Full Question: As an academic, you are in the business of producing research. I know it might sound odd to call it a \"business\", but frankly, you get paid to do it, and most of you wouldn't do it if you didn't get paid, hence it is a business and you're selling a product (your research) to your clients (the rest of society) and you get paid a price for that product (grants and aid and donations and other types of support from governments and other institutions).\n",
      "This means that there is a danger that your research output is driven by a self-serving bias. After all, the 'better' research you produce (as in, research that draws a lot of attention), the more of it you will sell and the more money you will make.\n",
      "How do academics controls themselves for this bias, that may be occurring consciously or subconsciously?\n",
      "One might say that peer-reviewing solves this exact problem, but I fear that all peer-reviewing accomplishes is moving the goalpost. Okay, so now the bias of the lone researcher is being controlled, but who controls the biases of the peers? After all, this bias is an industry-wide phenomenon. Your peers, the ones that review your research, have the exact same bias as you do, and are also interested in seeing your research be validated if it brings more attention to your field, a field which is obviously shared between you and your peers.\n",
      "Hence the bias affects you all at the same time. Who is controlling that? Is there a 3rd party? If not, how do academics, as a group, control themselves?\n",
      "Obviously, this question is more pertinent for less fact-based fields, so not for example mathematics, where if a wrong theorem is approved, it would be catastrophic and probably discovered soon enough, to the shame of all people involved. But for more experimental fields such as physics, medicine, etc., how do academics ensure that there isn't a cartel of researchers some where all (sub)consciously agreeing to promote research that advances their careers?\n",

      "Full Question: I am a master's student, and I will complete my master's program soon. During my second year of my MA program, I had to work on a two-semester group project because it was a requirement for the program. My question is the types of critical issues universities care about because universities seem to see issues like academic dishonesty as the most serious offense. Would universities care about the types of incidents that I am about to share below? \n",
      "Example:\n",
      "I was in a group project of five people, and four of the members were Caucasians (I am a racial minority female). I was treated terribly by two of the members (one female and one male). We had the final paper that was due just yesterday. The male, who was the editor, tends to procrastinate, and he literally waited until the last minute to make significant changes, and demanded from everyone to make the changes. We did this paper in a shared Google Doc by the way. I had another paper that was due at exactly the same date and time, so by the time that he started to become actively involved, I was much more focused on my other paper. He sent everyone an email on the morning of the day just before the due date, demanding significant changes. I was able to look at emails late that night, and he had sent me another email in the evening, asking if I was still involved in the project. By this time, I was already much more focused on my other paper. My response to his email was that I understand that we all have different schedules, and it is possible that we do things at different times. I had worked on the document and made changes a few days before he became actively involved. His response was basically how dare I challenge him, and called me a passive-aggressive person. He even dropped the F-bomb in his response. Now, the other girl. She also had similar tendencies to procrastinate and got along well with this male. On the document, she purposefully deleted my name, and put a comment, \"Let's keep it this way.\" My relationships with these two individuals had not been positive throughout the year, but I think this incident went very far. \n",
      "I never had these kinds of incidents during my four years of undergrad at a different university in the US. I am certain that this type of incident is very rare, especially at the graduate school level. I think that I should share my experience with the school because I think that this is a critical issue.\n",

      "Full Question: I have seen two different representations of neural networks when it comes to bias. Consider a \"simple\" neural network, with just an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. To compute the value of a neuron in the hidden layer, the weights and neurons from the input layer are multiplied, shifted by a bias and then activated by the activation function. To compute the values in the output layer, you may choose not to have a bias and have an identity activation function on this layer, so that this last calculation is just \"scaling\".\n",
      "Is it standard to have a \"scaling\" layer? You could say that there is a bias associated with each neuron, except those in the input layer correct (and those in the output layer when it is a scaling layer)? Although I suppose you could immediately shift any value you're given. Does the input layer have a bias?\n",
      "I have seen bias represented as an extra unchanging neuron in each layer (except the last) having value 1, so that the weights associated with the connections from this neuron correspond to the biases of the neurons in the next layer. Is this the standard way of viewing bias? Or is there some other way to interpret what bias is that is more closely described by \"a number that is added to the weighted sum before activation\"?\n",

      "Original Question: Proof of Maximization Bias in Q-learning?\n",
      "Full Question: In the textbook \"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\" by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, the concept of Maximization Bias is introduced in section 6.7, and how Q-learning \"over-estimates\" action-values is discussed using an example. However, a formal proof of the same is not presented in the textbook, and I couldn't get it anywhere on the internet as well. \n",
      "After reading the paper on Double Q-learning by Hado van Hasselt (link), I could understand to some extent why Q-learning \"over-estimates\" action values. Here is my (vague, informal) construction of a mathematical proof:\n",
      "We know that Temporal Methods (just like Monte Carlo methods), use sample returns instead of real expected returns as estimates, to find the optimal policy. These sample returns converge to the true expected returns over infinite trials, provided all the state-action pairs are visited. Thus the following notation is used, \n",
      "$$\\mathbb{E}[Q()] \\rightarrow q_\\pi()$$\n",
      "where $Q()$ is calculated from the sample return $G_t$ observed at every time-step. Over infinite trials, this sample return when averaged converges to it's expected value which is the true $Q$-value under the policy $\\pi$. Thus $Q()$ is really an estimate of the true $Q$-value $q_\\pi$.\n",
      "In section 3 on page 4 of the paper, Hasselt describes how the quantity $\\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)$ approximates $\\mathbb{E}[\\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)]$ which in turn approximates the quantity $\\max_a(\\mathbb{E}[Q(s_{t+1},a)])$ in Q-learning. Now, we know that the $\\max[]$ function is a convex function (proof). From Jensen's inequality, we have\n",
      "$$\\phi(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[\\phi(X)]$$ where $X$ is a random variable, and the function $\\phi()$ is a convex function. Thus,\n",
      "$$\\max_a(\\mathbb{E}[Q(s_{t+1},a)]) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[\\max_a(Q(s_{t+1}, a)]$$\n",
      "$$\\therefore \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) \\approx \\max_a(\\mathbb{E}[Q(s_{t+1},a)]) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[\\max_a(Q(s_{t+1}, a)]$$\n",
      "The quantity on the LHS of the above equation appears (along with $R_{t+1}$) as an estimate of the next action-value in the Q-learning update equation:\n",
      "$$Q(S_t,A_t) \\leftarrow (1-\\alpha)Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha[R_{t+1} + \\gamma\\max_aQ(S_{t+1}, a)] $$\n",
      "Lastly, we note that the bias of an estimate $T$ is given by:\n",
      "$$b(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T] - T$$\n",
      "Thus the bias of the estimate $\\max_a Q(s_{t+1},a)$ will always be positive:\n",
      "$$b(\\max_a Q(s_{t+1},a)) = \\mathbb{E}[\\max_a Q(s_{t+1},a)] - \\max_a Q(s_{t+1},a) \\geq 0$$\n",
      "In statistics literature, any estimate whose bias is positive is said to be an \"over-estimate\". Thus the action values are over-estimated by the Q-learning algorithm due to the $\\max[]$ operator, thus resulting in a $maximization$-$bias$.\n",
      "Are the arguments made above valid? I am a student, with no rigorous knowledge of random processes. Thus, please forgive me if any of the steps above are totally unrelated, and doesn't make sense in a more mathematically rigorous fashion. Please let me know, if there is a much better proof than this failed attempt. \n",

      "Full Question: I have read several resources, including previously asked questions such as this. I have also read arguments related to intercepts needed to separate linearly separable data. If my neural network can perform feature transformation, what is the need of a bias term?\n",
      "Since the weights are learnt, my network can optimise to fit the data. For example, if my data is in 2D coordinate plane, my equation without bias for a perceptron for the layer will be $W_1X_1 + W_2X_2$ where $X_1$ is x coordinate and $X_2$ is y coordinate, making $W_1$ and $W_2$ coefficients of all vectors along x and y direction. Their linear combination will cover the whole plane which allows my data to be transformed across a line with 0 intercept.\n",
      "For example, if my weight is 1.0 for input x, and my bias is 0.1, I might as well have weight $1+(0.1/\\bar x)$ (or any other value descriptive of x) and 0 bias to get the same result.\n",
      "Similar things happen for the arguments related to activation mentioned in the marked solution to the referenced question.\n",
      "In such a scenario, why is the bias needed?\n",
      "Edit: A lot of the answers offer reasonable arguments for the perceptron/single layer case, but perceptron was just an example. Do they hold for deep neural networks as well, because that allows for previous layers better transformation of inputs? As mentioned by some, 0 input will truly cause a problem which I agree with.\n",

      "Full Question: There is a lot of discussion about the overestimation bias for Deep Q Learning and similar off-policy action value estimation algorithms like DDPG. This is why methods like Double DQN and TD3 were created.\n",
      "But what I don't understand is, is it not true that every temporal difference estimation has an overestimation bias? If so, how come no one cares about it? In all literature I read, the overestimation bias is synonymous with Q learning methods. I can't see why this isn't a problem for all methods (other than methods that use Monte Carlo returns like REINFORCE).\n",
      "For example, if we did Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) with a 1-step bootstrap, the policy update pushes the policy network toward the distribution that maximizes the estimated advantage:\n",

      "If $V(s_{t + 1}, \\phi)$ is noisy and for some $s_{t + 1}$ the value is significantly overestimated, then the actions leading to this state have an overestimated advantage value, and the policy is optimized toward the actions with overestimated advantage. This error propagates to the target value of the learned $V$ function as new trajectories are sampled using a biased policy that favors actions with artificially high advantage values, potentially destabilizing everything.\n",

      "So here b is the bias as per machine learning. However, b is the y-intercept as per mathematics. By defination b can be defined in machine learning A value indicating how far apart the average of predictions is from the average of labels in the dataset. Is that mean bias(b) is the distance between some particular point of the red line(as per picture) to the true point(say a blue or green point).\n",
      "Now another confusion if this is the case then what is loss? As per defination loss is A measure of how far a model's predictions are from its label. Then what is the difference between loss and bias?\n",
      "Now, for weight, here, weight(m)means slope as per equation i). Mathematically slope can be define as\n",

      "However, weight$(w_1)$ can be defined in machine learning as A coefficient for a feature in a linear model. So my confusion is that is the procedure of finding weight is same as finding slope in mathematics?\n",

      "Full Question: I first trained a CNN on my dataset and got a loss plot that looks somewhat like this: \n",
      "Orange is training loss, blue is dev loss. As you can see, the training loss is lower than the dev loss, so I figured: I have (reasonably) low bias and high variance, which means I'm overfitting, so I should add some regularization: dropout, L2 regularization and data augmentation. After that, I get a plot like this: \n",
      "Now we see that the variance has decreased and the bias has increased. The model is overfitting less, is this correct? However, I would actually select the first model because it has lower validation loss.\n",
      "My question is: in most literature, for the bias-variance tradeoff, they show the validation loss going up, but in my experiments this is not the case, so are these models actually overfitting? Are you overfitting as soon as training loss goes below validation loss, or only if validation loss goes back up? And is it okay to choose a model with high variance if the validation loss is lower?\n",
      "I found this answer on a similar question, but what if your problem is so complex that you can't find an architecture that can overfit and then properly regularize the architecture? I can find an architecture that gets a training loss close(r) to zero, but then I can't really add enough dropout to make sure the variance is low. Also if I add augmentation my validation loss also goes up. Finally the answer confuses me, the answerer is talking about variance on the training set? But isn't bias always related to training loss and variance to dev loss?\n",

      "Full Question: A layman curiosity here. All I know about the courts comes from TV shows, which are, apparently, not real very much. However, given their original intent of educate populace about the legal system, there should be some semblance of realism, or so I hope.\n",
      "Anyway, the question comes from watching several episodes of Judge Judy. She seems to have a very strong bias against young people. In more than one episode she said something like this: \"How do you know that a teenager is lying? His lips move.\"\n",
      "So she affirmed multiple times in several unrelated episodes that she does not trust teenagers' words for no reason other than being teenagers. Bias of that magnitude obviously puts teenage litigants at strong disadvantage. However, Judge Judy has never recused herself in trials (or mediations, whatever they are) on the basis of her own bias.\n",
      "Thus the question: would unapologetic and openly professed judicial bias like that be tolerated in real courts? Would the party being biased against be able to push judicial recusal?\n",

      "Original Question: How do concepts like intent, discrimination, and bias apply to an Artificial Intelligence agent?\n",
      "Full Question: Background\n",
      "I work at a financial institution in the United States and have been researching the regulatory impacts of Artificial Intelligence recently - specifically the simple purpose-specific systems we have today like Alexa, Siri, or the AI that navigates your Tesla when you switch on autopilot.  Based on some googling [1] [2], the current standards seem to be that there aren't a lot of specific regulations that apply to the AI agent (with the exception of self-driving cars), but the normal regulations that apply when using a human agent would apply if you substitute an AI-based decision process.  The top answer on a related topic here on StackExchange seems to support the idea that the regulations applied to the human apply to the AI agent as well (at least in Hong Kong).\n",
      "We're currently shying away to research into the legal implications of AIs that can learn any task, much like a human.  These are sometimes referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs) and the most aggressive estimate I've seen in my research places them emerging sometime in the next 100 - 200 years.  A problem for future generations!\n",
      "The Question:\n",
      "This raises a couple of questions in my mind about a couple of legal concepts that have clear definitions when applied to a human or certain kinds of AI, but get fuzzy with other ones.  Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you determine an AI agent's intent?\n",
      "How can you tell if an AI agent is biased in its decisions?\n",
      "How would the concept of discrimination apply to an AI agent?  How would you prosecute it?\n",
      "\n",
      "A Specific Example:\n",
      "For instance, take the anti-discrimination provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).  In the case of a decision-tree based AI agent discrimination is obvious - if you add in a rule that makes different decisions based on race, gender, age, or other protected factors you have a discriminatory model.\n",
      "In the case of a statistically driven Machine Learning model, this is less obvious.  For instance, a neural network based model could accept address data as part of its decision.  After examining hundreds of thousands of credit applications, the machine learning model could potentially derive information about income distribution from address or similar fields and end up discriminating against applicants that match certain traits.  In this case you accept no information on age, sex, or ethnicity but still discriminate based on these factors since the model found some problematic trends in the data that it was trained on.\n",
      "Recap:\n",
      "With this in mind, my questions are:\n",
      "\n",
      "What are your thoughts on regulations that refer to intent or bias as they relate to AI agents - particularly ones that don't operate on explicitly defined rules?\n",
      "Is there any precedent in this space that we could look to to guide decisions on AI risk?\n",
      "Does anyone have thoughts on where regulation in this space might head?\n",
      "\n",

      "Original Question: Recourse for biased judges presiding over trial\n",
      "Full Question: Alice has brought a civil claim against Barbara, and the paperwork has all been filed as directed in the written case directions. Alice has been self representing while Barbara has hired Barry as her high end professional representation.\n",
      "Then it comes time for a trial / substantive hearing. In principle, the court should make special allowances for Alice as the self-represented party, while the professional lawyers representing Barbara should be held to a higher bar. Alice should be offered more assistance in conveying her case in sessions of open court. But in fact Alice finds that the judges appear rather biased against her: instead of helping her to make out her case with guidance, they are quite arrogant, brusque and snappy. Alice can hardly get out 3 words before being interrupted by the judge to be accused of either repeating herself, or rambling about irrelevant or unimportant topics before she has even been able to explain the full point and its particular supposed relevance to the case. They further accuse Alice when she tries to be rigorous and clear in her arguments of effectively condescending the court which Alice can rest assured, she is told by the judge, is expert in the law and does not need to be educated in it by her. Finally Alice is cut short from making her final few points that she would like to pose because the judges thinks they have heard enough even though in reality they have hardly heard anything from Alice who has hardly had any opportunities to complete a full thought. Meanwhile Barry is allowed to speak at length until he is finished.\n",
      "On the other hand, Barbara’s highly qualified professional representative Barry is allowed to speak virtually without any interruptions from the court whatsoever. When the court does on one occasion cut in, it is merely to affirm and bring even further one of Barry’s arguments but never to challenge or negate anything which he had said. Barry however has barely said anything of legal or logical significance or insight but rather seems to do a lot of vapid rambling about totally insignificant topics, certainly repeating himself a very great deal, and much of his rambling in fact amounts to in insightful insults toward the other side.\n",
      "While no verdict has yet been handed down, but Alice has serious concerns as to the conduct of the trial and the impartiality and propriety of the judge in presiding over it, what recourse does she have to register these concerns about the fairness of the trial?\n",

      "Original Question: If a judge constructs arguments for the prosecution in judgment is that grounds for appeal?\n",
      "Full Question: I recently read a judgment in which the judge constructed arguments that normally one would have expected the prosecution to make. In fact, the defense in the case argued that the prosecutor failed to demonstrate their case by not arguing certain points that they should have. This seemed to create no problem for the judge who just \"remedied\" the situation by making the arguments that the prosecution should have made in her judgment.\n",
      "My understanding is that judges are supposed to weigh the merits of the arguments put before them, not make new arguments to repair or strengthen the case for one of the sides. I thought that the judge's tendency to bolster the prosecution's case with such arguments smacked of judicial bias in favor of the prosecution.\n",

      "Original Question: On the limits of a law clerk to the judge to &quot;co-judge&quot; a case and how the communications should be recorded\n",
      "Full Question: On Nov 3, 2023, Judge Engoron issued a gag order to Trump's lawyers barring them (as well as Trump) from speaking about the judge's staff.  This is precipitated by Chris Kise's argument that the law clerk Allison Greenfield is \"co-judging\" the case and as Trump's lawyer he has \"to make a record if he sees potential bias.\"\n",
      "However, in Judge Engoron's order he made the argument that their frequent communication is \"of particular trust and confidence\", likening it to \"the kind of professional interchange that might be found between long-time colleagues in a law firm.\"\n",
      "My question has to do with how the US court system draws the line between legitimate vs. improper contribution that a law clerk can provide to the judge, and whether any of those communication should be recorded as part of the case for later review, potentially by a higher court.  One possible factor is that this case is a bench trial where the judge is also the jury.  Since the defendants cannot benefit from protection afforded them by the many rules regarding selective evidence presented to the jury and of the jury selection itself (which protects them from bias) maybe there are rules that can protect the defendants in lieu of this?\n",

      "Original Question: Does everybody have a bias?\n",
      "Full Question: I was in a heated debate with a housemate, and they mentioned that 'Everyone has a bias'. At the time I disagreed, and these were my reasons:\n",
      "To say 'all have a bias' is to then say that I have a bias. If I have a bias, then I was either given a bias, or I had taken up a bias. For, to have something must mean I was given that something or I had taken that something. \n",
      "With an example:\n",
      "Can a baby born into this world then exist with a bias? If not, then a bias is not something that you are born with, therefore, a bias is something given or taken by the environment? You could alternatively say, that you are born with the capacity to have a bias, but still, even then to be born with the capability of something may also imply being born with the capability to not have that something.\n",
      "So, I could then say that the statement 'everyone has a bias', the arrangement of the simple sentence is wrong? would it be more useful to say 'everyone has the capacity to have and not have a bias'? as a bias is something that is conditioned not predetermined as a cause of being born? Or, is the effect being the bias a thing that derives from the cause, which is birth. which is then to say that 'everyone has a bias' is correct.\n",
      "Otherwise, with the opinions of others, is there any proof to 'Everyone has a bias' as being completely true or wrong.\n",

      "Original Question: How does Bias affect the reliability of a process?\n",
      "Full Question: So my attempt is to define a process and test it on its reliability.\n",
      "In a discussion, an argument was made that a consensus on the reliability of the process is needed for a process to be reliable.\n",
      "Aka.: If not everyone agrees that the process is reliable, then it follows that the process is not reliable.\n",
      "To give more context: In an answer/debate, I proposed a process (although not in great detail) and argued its reliability. One of the opposing arguments was that this process is not reliable because there are a lot of people/communities that would disagree that it is reliable.\n",
      "EDIT\n",
      "Since my debate partner made his position more clear in the comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"one way/factor to measure reliability is by checking how many people\n",
      "who follow the same process agree on the conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this position still prompts the following question but deals better with the fallacy argument raised in the comments. But that's only my opinion.\n",
      "END EDIT\n",
      "The Problem I have with this is that people will have already drawn their conclusions, meaning if there is a process X with results [A, B, C,...], then people exist that assume that A is the correct solution. This means that if the process results in B, those people will be biased towards that process and will reject its reliability regardless.\n",
      "E.g. climate change: There are various scientific methods, checking different things and many people therefore arrive at the conclusion that the is a climate change happening.\n",
      "However, some people don't think that climate change is real and therefore question the reliability of the process used.\n",
      "(Note: I don't want a debate about climate change. I am just using it as an example, feel free to use a more appropriate one)\n",
      "So here are my questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a difference between objective reliability and perceived reliability?\n",
      "Can Bias even impact reliability? Is it even a good argument for/against the reliability that some people agree/disagree about the reliability of a process?\n",
      "Can the reliability be measured by consensus? How is it factored in?\n",
      "Is reliabilism even possible when dealing with greatly controversial topics?\n",
      "When defining a process, how can potential biases be accounted for?\n",
      "\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem I do see with this is that it's difficult to determine the bias since the author of the process could also be biased.\n",

That is, his immoral conduct creates a \"bias\" in our mind against him for an event that is purely scientific in nature and morality has nothing to do with it. \n",

      "Original Question: If knowledge is structural, does &quot;confirmation bias&quot; follow of necessity?\n",
      "Full Question: That 'knowledge' is structural is fairly uncontroversial. Although there are certainly different types, I would like for sake of this question to characterize (what I see as) a generalization of the concept: Knowledge are familiarity or understanding of particular items of experience. It can be communicated, though not always perfectly, and thus are sometimes \"fuzzy\" (people may have slightly different ideas about the facts). The more structured, the less fuzzy knowledge becomes, but then less facts are accommodated by such a structure.\n",
      "When we think of \"Confirmation bias\" it is usually in terms of an error of induction, or a psychological propensity to misconstrue. However I would like to likewise expand and generalize the idea:  In the case of psychological propensity it manifests at many different levels, from the interpretation of language to sense perception. Confirmation bias is (loosely) fitting knowables into some structure established by prior \"knowledge\". (If one is fanciful one may even make a case for probability distributions and other quantum phenomena)\n",

      "Now without getting into a very long tirade, this is the hypothesis I got to:\n",
      "Knowledge structures are formed by Confirmation bias.\n",
      "Edit: From some of the references I've come to realize that my use of \"comfirmation bias\" need to be better elucidated. There is a phenomenon/process, recognizable as the same, and most apparent in the guise of confirmation bias in the areas of sociology and psychology, but also in the physical and metaphysical that for the sake of this question I will call Existential Normalization (EN). EN is then a reification of this phenomenon as distinct from knowledge, and knowledge structures, and operating on all levels from social constructs down to the aggregations of matter.\n",
      "Note that now \"confirmation bias\" has changed from a somewhat vexing phenomenon into a sort of ontological entity. Knowledge is structured fact which is formed by EN, which is informed by Knowledge. A triad of concepts that allows for what IS to become MORE.\n",

They have different frameworks to understand the same phenomenon, and different goals for our reactions to it, and I understand and like them. However, because of their nature, it is necessary that they have different interpretations in different situations, making even practitioners disagree with each others. They may even claim that there are things that can only be understood by direct experience, and are ineffable or inexpressible, making the philosophy inevitably mystical. I think, even when everything is on the right track, we cannot know for sure that our intuition/wisdom is correct without verbalize it. How do they make sure that an interpretation is correct and not just confirmation bias?\n",

      "Original Question: Burden of Proof vs. Confirmation Bias vs. Falsifiability\n",
      "Full Question: I think I'm using the concepts Burden of Proof, Confirmation Bias and Falsifiability inappropriately, or muddling the notions in my way of thinking.  I just looked up these concepts on google a few minutes ago, so hopefully someone can clarify things for me.\n",
      "I have a friend on my team and he's not pulling his weight.  Everyone outperforms him and puts in more hours of work than him.  He replies, \"I like to sleep 16 hours every day because once I'm awake, I'm much more alert and efficient.\"\n",
      "I tried to challenge my friend saying he should try to sleep less. If he sleeps 16 hours, that leaves very little time for work (since he also parties with his friends and hangs out at burger king every day).  IF he slept less, lived a healthier life style, it will be better for him down the road.\n",
      "He replied, \"I saw a youtube video saying that it is healthier for humans to sleep more and not sleep less.  When I compared sleeping 16 hours vs. sleeping 12 hours, I was able to confirm that I felt more refreshed after 16 hours of sleep than 12 hours of sleep.\"\n",
      "I tried debating him, but it seems the Burden of Proof is on me to prove to him sleeping 16 hours a day and eating burger king 15 meals per week is not a good idea.  And he'll rebuttal  by saying he found youtube videos and blog posts to confirm what he already believes.\n",
      "So my question is, isn't it a dangerous for society for the burden of proof to be on me as the challenger to prove to my friend his life style is unhealthy (because it causes our universal healthcare to sky rocket, bad influence on younger people, etc...)?  Isn't it dangerous for society for my friend to use confirmation bias to re-inforce his decision to lead an unhealthy life style?  \n",
      "Wouldn't it be a safer and more productive option for society if my friend used an approach of falsifiability, where he should actively try to falsify his own beliefs and replace it with new+better knowledge?  So if I submit a contradictory belief, the burden of proof is on him to try to falsify his own beliefs using the additional data I've provided him?\n",
      "But then I see a problem with what I just said in my previous paragraph.  If my friend says, \"Earth's gravitational constant is 9.81m/s^2\", and I submit to him, \"Earth's gravitational constant is not a constant, but is a box full of cereal, aliens and fuzzy wuzzy wombats.\"  It would be a complete waste of time for my friend to investigate my claim to falsify his beliefs.  A good way to avoid wasting people's time is for me making the stupid claim to take on the the burden of proof.\n",
      "So why does it seem like the burden of proof is ALWAYS on the person making the claim?  Why can't it be SOMETIMES be on the person making the claim?  Other times, it is up to the listener to do his on falsifiability research?  Or is there already a process for me to follow to decide who should have the burden of proof given each specific context?\n",
      "I'm so confused.....I'm clearly misunderstanding how these tools are used...\n",

      "Original Question: Name for the fallacy where a person claims that bias always proves the opposite?\n",
      "Full Question: I'm unsure how to word this as usual. An example of what I'm talking about would be:\n",
      "X claims that the dicerolls in a video game are biased.\n",
      "Y claims it only appears so because of negativity bias, which is real.\n",
      "X then takes count of all the die rolls across several matches in the video game, and finds that the results are in fact biased.\n",
      "Y claims the results must be fraudulent because the claim must be false due to negativity bias.\n",
      "Essentially, Y is refuting evidence because the existence of bias proves that such a result must be false and thus any evidence to the contrary must also be false (even if it can easily be confirmed by a third party). Of course, whether or not bias exists has no relevance on the veracity of a claim. That's like saying a judge declares everyone guilty, thus everyone that went through them MUST be innocent even if they were caught on camera doing what they were accused of. Or a reverse example of this. Confirmation bias always disproves the claim that the dice are fair, even if testing shows that the dice are fair.\n",
      "This is a rather annoying one I've encounted with a certain video game. I even see this with people who had no idea the game even existed claiming that the dice rolls in it must be fair because of negativity bias, even if hard evidence proves otherwise. Fun times.\n",

      "Original Question: Is there a name for the idea of inherent bias in an authority figure or expert?\n",
      "Full Question: We often appeal to experts and authorities due to the usefulness of their acquired knowledge, and a lot of the time, this is a fairly sensible thing to do.\n",
      "However, very often, I feel like there is a certain bias that is being introduced whenever one does so, and I am wondering whether this phenomenon has been deemed important enough to have been given a name. \n",
      "Here's what I mean: an expert or an authority has chosen to be an expert or an authority. This choice implies an inherent bias that has lead them to take this particular path in life. Thus regardless of how much factual knowledge they acquire or how well they hone their instinct, this bias may possibly remain present in their mind and influence the way in which they transmit their expertise to others.\n",
      "For example, imagine you wish to discuss Christianity with an expert. What sort of person becomes an expert in Christianity to begin with? Presumably all kinds of people, but I am sure if you pulled out the stats, you would see a remarkable number of Christians being experts in Christianity. Which isn't surprising, as their passion for their religion was what probably lead them to study it in detail to begin with. We thus might imagine a scenario where a critique of the Christian religion leads us to ask the help of an expert ... who happens to have a bias in favor of Christianity.\n",
      "Likewise, imagine an expert in motor-racing. Presumably, many of these will be petrol heads (car enthusiasts), since their a-priori love for racing and vehicles was what lead them to become experts in this field in the first place. Imagine a scenario where there's a critique of the environmental impact of motor-racing, and we are lead to talk to these experts ... who happen to have a bias in favor of motor-racing.\n",

      "Original Question: Does following logic necessarily require one to conclude that they are objective and have no bias?\n",
      "Full Question: In social psychology, naïve realism is the human tendency to believe that we see the world around us objectively, and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, irrational, or biased. It is considered as one of the four major insights in the field.\n",
      "The three tenets that make up a naïve realist:\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.\n",
      "Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and interpret it in a rational manner.\n",
      "Assume that others who do not share the same views must be ignorant, irrational, or biased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last two tenets are the necessarily results of following logic. The question is: would the first one is too?\n",
      "In my understanding, logic only studies the relationship between statements, not the truth value of the premise. For example, if we have a deduction:\n",
      "All men are motorbikes.\n",
      "Socrates is a man.\n",
      "Therefore, Socrates is a motorbike. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then logic only confirms whether the conclusion fits the premise. Even if the induction is made with scientific method, then a logician will still assume that there is a chance that the premise is wrong. \n",
      "However, if they have checked and tested the premise many times, then they have to believe that their action to see the world is objectively and without bias. This is more true in the case that logician acknowledges their human biases and distortions, and has done everything in their best to check that. The belief that they are objective and the belief that they may be wrong aren't mutually exclusive. That belief, therefore, is a necessary consequence of believing in logic.\n",
      "To put it in another way, there are 3 additional arguments in parallel with the specific problem the logician has to deal with:\n",
      "\n",
      "A: They follow the laws of logic\n",
      "B: They know that they may be wrong \n",
      "C: They are objective and have no bias\n",
      "\n",
      "I think A is sufficient to conclude C (in fact it may be that A ⇔ C). B is an additional filter to make sure (a) A actually exists, (b) the premises of the specific problem are correct, and (c) no implicit premise is overlooked or forgotten. But at the same time it makes the logician less confident at the moment they need to be. B makes A believable and makes C unbelievable, even though A and C are the same.\n",

Bob also believes that he is an expert in a totally unrelated field B. However he is not taken seriously by the experts of B. Still, Bob dismisses authorities of B by quoting himself.\n",

They say you are just as biased about your beliefs as they are (Tu Quoque fallacy) and that it all depends on your 'worldview'.\n",

For example, someone who believes in a monotheistic God is taken a bit more seriously than someone who believes in polytheism who is in turn taken more seriously than anyone who believes in Santa Claus. Even supposedly sophisticated philosophies such as Kant’s transcendental idealism are taken seriously. But readers of him still don’t know or agree upon what it even means. Is the disagreement due to the complex hard to understand nature of the argument or just the mere result of mental masturbation over nothing?\n",

      "Original Question: In the non-Muslim world what are the origins of historical bias against the Ottoman Empire?\n",
      "Full Question: Some narratives of the recent terror attack in Christchurch imply that even though conflicts, battles, and  invasions among various warring empires ravaged Europe throughout its history, somehow the Ottoman invasion and regime is singled out as worse in the non-Muslim world as if Communist, Nazi, and Fascist Empires were somehow much better, or in other words, are more acceptable than the Ottomans. Also, genocides of Bosnia are not much talked about, as if that was not enough of a price for Muslims to pay.\n",
      "This is like saying, \"Even if he killed 6 million Jews or 2 million Ukrainians or a few thousand Bosnians, he is our homeboy. So, just forget that.\"\n",
      "One point could be: Ottomans never either accepted or paid the price for their atrocities. They might have never accepted but neither did the Russians or Serbs or Croatians. On the other hand, Ottoman empire was invaded and split, and modern Turkey was a de facto ally of the Allied forces during the WW2.\n",
      "It is not true that this narrative is limited only to some extremist groups, not the mass population.  This is proven by going through comment sections of various social media platforms, news sites, and so on. Also, the rise in minority persecution in various developed countries.\n",

      "Original Question: How does one parse the notion of &quot;systemic racism&quot; in the context of poverty?\n",
      "Full Question: One will often read statistics like: \"Black Americans are dying from the coronavirus at more than twice the rate of whites.\" The obvious inference, here, is that blacks have less access to healthcare than do whites. The story is the same when it comes to the wealth and income gaps, as well as access to education and so on. The disparities are simply undeniable.\n",
      "It remains to be explained, however, whether this lack of opportunity is owed directly to economic circumstances, or whether it is a result of an ongoing and active kind of current racism. A black person who cannot afford healthcare is in a very different situation than a black person who is denied a job in favour of a white worker directly in virtue of his race.\n",
      "In most conversations, it seems to me that people conflate these two perspectives. Without a doubt, the economic disparities we observe between blacks and whites has everything to do with America's history of racism. But if this is the case, it seems to me that the term systemic racism is slightly misleading because it does not mean that racism is currently systemically enforced. If, when people refer to systemic racism, they mean that people are actively pursuing the maintenance of these disparities, then they have a more difficult case to make. Generalized statistics certainly do not seem sufficient to support this narrative because of the economic layers. \n",
      "Now, of course, this picture is complicated by the idea of implicit bias. Sure, there may not be as many vicious, believing and committed racists running around the US as there once was. You might say, then, that these disparities are deeply aggravated by an underlying psychological bias. But again, how are you supposed to demarcate the extent to which this bias is present versus other factors?\n",
      "Defenders of the term are thus left with the unfalsifiable claim that implicit (and sometimes explicit) bias contribute significantly to the data, while denialists can simply argue that everything can be chalked up to \"past racism.\" What are the best ways to get around these generalizations and further (and more precisely) parse what is obviously a complex issue?\n",
      "EDIT: Let me put this another way for those who are confused. We observe disparities in many areas (wealth, education, healthcare, policing, etc.) between black people and non-black people. My question is this: How might we measure how much current/ongoing explicit and implicit prejudice accounts for maintaining these disparities versus other factors (cultural, sociological, economic, etc.)?\n",
      "Here is a crude example. It could be the case that more black people are arrested than whites because cops are generally racist (implicitly or explicitly). But it could also be the case that black people just commit more crimes because of cultural and economic factors. Now, obviously the issue here is nuanced, it's not going to be a one or the other answer. How can we approximate the degree to which each is responsible for the statistical disparities we observe?\n",

She has taken three studies so far. More seriously, when she took the first one, I refused it. Then she sent out an official letter including some other faculty, saying that she took my research proposal because it was originally her idea and I stole it. Worse still, she then forced me to write the paper for her.\n",

This came after the administration made very strong pronouncements that \"we must increase graduation rates...\" I sarcastically suggested we patent the method of getting such a great surge in success rate. All other faculty were silent and it appears to me that this is a national trend. Nobody seems to care about quality. \n",
      "Surely, to have these graduation rates surge, some variables need to change. None of them did -- same poorly prepared students, same faculty and no revolutionary education discoveries. Conclusion -- good old grade inflation and social promotion is the cause, but here prompted by a snap of fingers of the corporate executives and executed gladly by compliant faculty. Am I missing something? \n",

Suppose there was a structure in place at the university for both programs to be undertaken concurrently (an implication of this is that I would not have to pay tuition for the normally unfunded master's program).\n",

I don't expect this is likely to happen - and if for whatever reason I don't want to or can't make the switch to the Field B PhD program at that university, I would see the Field A PhD through no matter what.\n",

      "I should mention here that I am a foreigner to both countries. Therefore, I had to apply for a work permit to move to Canada from the US. In addition, I require a full-job to remain in valid status in the US. \n",
      "I applied for a Canadian work permit based on the job offer as early as I could---which was only three weeks before the tentative start date on the official letter. The processing times estimate on the Canadian website for such a process were two weeks at the time. Happily, I resigned from my US job to finalize my move and get ready for the visa. \n",
      "Unfortunately, the visa has not yet arrived for another 4 weeks and my US status will expire soon unless I'm hired immediately. Therefore, I applied for a local postdoc position and received another offer. My previous supervisor in the US would not be able to re-hire me immediately and the current offer is the best option so far. \n",
      "My question is as follows: I understand the resigning was a mistake in the first place. However, Is it justifiable, professionally and ethically, to accept another position in the US?  The position in Canada is ideal to me, but unfortunately, I have to commit to the US position for about a year if I sign.  \n",

      "Full Question: I am building a generative model chatbot as a research and learning project. One of the most important parts of my project is to research ways in which I can make this chatbot work in a consistently ethical fashion. \n",
      "This chatbot is simply a single Seq2Seq network running on my local machine. It can't be interacted with over the internet (yet), although I may end up creating a way to do that. It has no feedback loops of any kind as of right now, though reinforcement learning with a loop might be helpful.\n",
      "The idea is that there would be some sort of unchanging knowledgebase for the chatbot to use that has hard-coded ethical statements and values that the bot has no ability to change. Whenever a question is asked of the chatbot,before being inputted to the network, the knowledgebase is searched and relevant facts will be appended to the input (separated from regular inptu by  tokens. \n",

      "Full Question: i was discussing ethic with chatGPT and I asked \"can the law 0 solve this dilemma ?\", expecting an answer related to Asimov law of robotic. But I got this instead :\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Law 0\" is not a widely recognized concept in the field of AI ethics. However, some experts have proposed additional ethical principles or \"laws\" to complement or expand upon the Three Laws of Robotics described by Isaac Asimov.\n",
      "In general, the goal of these additional principles is to address ethical dilemmas and challenges that arise in the development and deployment of AI systems. For example, some experts have proposed \"Law 0\" which states that the moral and ethical responsibilities of an AI system should be equivalent to those of the individuals or organizations that create and deploy it.\n",
      "While additional ethical principles, such as \"Law 0\", can provide valuable guidance for considering the ethical implications of AI technology, it is important to remember that the development and deployment of AI systems is a complex and ongoing process that will likely require ongoing debate and refinement of ethical principles and practices.\n",
      "Ultimately, the ethical considerations related to AI and robotics are complex and multifaceted, and it will require the ongoing collaboration of experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and engineering, to develop effective approaches to guiding the development and deployment of these technologies in a responsible and ethical manner.\n",

Also touches on goals, implied by intention, whether awareness is a requirement, and what constitutes awareness.

      "Original Question: Can we use a messenger that does not alter the AI to solve the control problem?\n",
      "Full Question: Instead of directly communicating with the AI, we would instead communicate with a messenger, who would relay our communications to the AI. The messenger would have no power to alter the AI's hardware or software in any way, or to communicate with anything or anyone, except relaying communications to and from the AI and humans asking questions. The messenger could be human, of a software bot. The primary job (and only reason) of the AI would be to act as a filter, not relaying any requests for release back, only the answer to the question asked. The ethics of this method are another debate. \n",
      "The AI would have to be physically isolated from all outside contact, other than 8 light sensors, and 8 LEDs. The messenger would operate 8 other LEDs, and receive information from 8 light sensors as well. Each AI light sensor would be hooked up to a single messenger controlled LED, and vice versa. Through this system, the two parties could communicate via flashes of light, and since there are 8, the flashes would signal characters in Unicode. \n",

This is not a programming or specific hardware question.\n",
      "On average, how much energy is consumed for each response that Open AI's public chatgpt-3 provides?\n",

      "How does this compare to a Google/Duck Duck Go/Bing search inquiry?\n",
      "I read somewhere an OpenAI employee on the ChatGPT team that the computer power used to provide responses to queries is \"ridiculous\", and there's documentation of the size of the memory requirements of hosting servers and parameters but without knowing its throughput for example it's hard to quantify the energy consumption.\n",
      "I often get more interesting results from Chat GPT than Duck Duck Go on certain types of queries where I used to know the answer but cannot remember the answer. IN these cases I can fact check for myself, I'm looking for a memory prompts with names and jargon that will remind me.\n",
      "Also when seeking out counter-views to my own (say critiques of degrowth or heterodoxy economics concepts) Chat GPT is good at providing names and papers/reports/books that critiques the view I provide it.\n",

      "Full Question: I just read this seemingly interesting and important insight from Eliezer Yudkowsky on Twitter, which I copy here for reference:\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think people realize what a big deal it is that Stanford retrained a LLaMA model, into an instruction-following form, by cheaply fine-tuning it on inputs and outputs from text-davinci-003.\n",
      "It means:  If you allow any sufficiently wide-ranging access to your AI model, even by paid API, you're giving away your business crown jewels to competitors that can then nearly-clone your model without all the hard work you did to build up your own fine-tuning dataset.  If you successfully enforce a restriction against commercializing an imitation trained on your I/O - a legal prospect that's never been tested, at this point - that means the competing checkpoints go up on bittorrent.\n",
      "I'm not sure I can convey how much this is a brand new idiom of AI as a technology.  Let's put it this way:\n",
      "If you put a lot of work into tweaking the mask of the shoggoth, but then expose your masked shoggoth's API - or possibly just let anyone build up a big-enough database of Qs and As from your shoggoth - then anybody who's brute-forced a core unmasked shoggoth can gesture to your shoggoth and say to their shoggoth \"look like that one\", and poof you no longer have a competitive moat.\n",
      "It's like the thing where if you let an unscrupulous potential competitor get a glimpse of your factory floor, they'll suddenly start producing a similar good - except that they just need a glimpse of the inputs and outputs of your factory.  Because the kind of good you're producing is a kind of pseudointelligent gloop that gets sculpted; and it costs money and a simple process to produce the gloop, and separately more money and a complicated process to sculpt the gloop; but the raw gloop has enough pseudointelligence that it can stare at other gloop and imitate it.\n",
      "In other words:  The AI companies that make profits will be ones that either have a competitive moat not based on the capabilities of their model, OR those which don't expose the underlying inputs and outputs of their model to customers, OR can successfully sue any competitor that engages in shoggoth mask cloning.\n",

      "However, there has been a lot of pushback to these systems. This is largely because apparently the training data they were fed included lots of art that was used without the creators' consent. Sites such as DeviantArt and other image-sharing platforms were apparently scraped for training data without regard for the consent of the original creators or licensing.\n",
      "Since these images were used as training data without the appropriate licensing, the AI systems that is benefiting from and using that data could be used to generate images that are then used commercially, which would violate such licenses as CC BY-NC-SA, and no attribution or credit has been provided for the original artists.\n",

      "Full Question: Many threads (and courses) such as this and this one suggest that you should apply normalization to the test data using the parameters used in the training set. But other some discussions I've found like this one and this one that suggest that applying the normalization to the test set is not really required and it might depends on many factors such as the model used for training or the nature of the test data.\n",

      "If I apply normalization using the recommended way I get 79% accuracy, (and to be honest it's not interesting for me)\n",

      "So, I don't know what my neural network performs better on test unseen data if I use the second method. I really I want continue using the second method for this particular model, but I don't feel good about it and feels like it's wrong or cheating.\n",
      "Now, I have one last argument. The last link I provided, have one answer that says this:\n",
      "\"..This is all dependent on size of data sets & whether both train and test are equally representative of the domain you are trying to model. If you have thousands of data points and the test set is fully representative of the training set (hard to prove) then either method will be fine...\"\n",
      "The dataset I use is a refined version of its predecessor (NSL-KDD dataset). The authors said \"There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets\" and that they have removed any redundant values. So I feel, this dataset is uniform and the test set actually representative according to the authors. So can I use the second approach?\n",

      "Full Question: The simple background is that someone has misspent some money that they weren't really authorized for. We are gearing up and may soon be plaintiffs and this person will become a defendant.\n",
      "The question concerns what our attorney is obligated to do or not do if he/she draws an educated and experienced conclusion that the behavior of the defendant in relation to what they did, is criminal. (we will say non-violent and nobody is in danger of harm). Does our attorney have an obligation to contact law enforcement, or is the attorney obligated not to legally? Or is there an ethics rule about what an attorney should do in this type of situation? \n",

      "Original Question: Can there ever be a conflict between law and professional ethics in the practice of law?\n",
      "Full Question: Tl;dr version. The so-called \"ethics/law divide\" is often discussed in the context of non-legal professions. Does such a divide exist in the practice of law or is it a contradiction?\n",
      "The ethics of quite a number of professions acknowledge at least a theoretical possibility that breaking the law might be ethically justifiable or even necessary. The classical example is a physician practicing under an oppressive regime who is ordered to perform experimentation on political prisoners or assist in a genocide. Most medical ethicists would agree that the physician has a duty to refuse to participate regardless of whether such refusal results in civil or criminal liability attaching to the physician. An article from the perspective of medical practice is Where the law and the ethics conflict? from the joint AREC, UK Clinical Ethics Network Conference ‘Ethics in Common’. For a discussion of some potential practical examples of ethical/legal conflict and dilemmas in the practice of social work, see the article \"When Ethics and the Law Collide\" from Social Work Today.\n",
      "At first glance, it seems that these ethical principles would not apply to the practice of law, since lawyers derive their professional competence to practice, even their reason for existence, directly from the law and the courts rather than practicing despite the presence of laws and courts potentially trying to steer them astray from the principles of their professions. That is, physicians, social workers, nurses, physical therapists, clinical psychologists, dentists, teachers, child care workers, etc. walk a fine line every day between upholding the ethical principles of their professions while at the same time remaining subject to the law and its own requirements. They have two \"masters\", so to speak. Lawyers have no master but the law.\n",
      "Is there any precedent either way (in any jurisdiction or before any court) on whether there can or cannot possibly be an ethical/legal conflict or dilemma with respect to the practice of law? An example of such a conflict might look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a lawyer admitted to the bar in Ruritania. A new Ruritanian statute (cite) requires all lawyers to affirmatively report to the police all clients \"who have made anti-government statements or who are reasonably believed by the lawyer to have participated in an anti-government protest in the past three years\" under penalty of imprisonment and fine of the lawyer, but the latest bulletin of the Standing Ethics Committee of the Bar Association of Ruritania asserts that complying with this law is unethical and that lawyers who comply will be disbarred regardless of whether the law is upheld as constitutional or not. What should I do? What can I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "From another perspective, could there be a scenario where legal ethics permit or even require a lawyer to violate constitutional statutes, commit blatant crimes, disobey valid court orders, knowingly remain in contempt of court, disregard prevailing rules of court, insult or threaten a judge, or otherwise get \"in trouble\" with the law in the name of upholding legal ethics, or is adherence to the law above all else the sine qua non of legal ethics?\n",
      "Bringing everything back to the beginning, do lawyers living and practicing under oppressive regimes have some ethical duty to help themselves or their clients disobey blatantly \"wrong\" laws? In other words, can the law itself be unethical enough that lawyers are not professionally obligated to follow it? Plenty of extreme or not-so-extreme hypotheticals can be considered. For example, suppose a law is passed banning gay people from receiving legal representation. You (a lawyer) have investigated this law and found no reason for it to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, because the laws in your country just suck that way. Can you justify representing a gay person in violation of this law as your ethical duty as a lawyer who believes that access to counsel for everyone is a fundamental ethic of lawyering, or would such an action be a textbook example of unethical legal practice?\n",
      "Just to be clear, this question is from the perspective of the theory and philosophy of law and legal practice rather than a question about any specific jurisdiction. If this has been formally addressed in any specific legal system or jurisdiction, an answer from the perspective is welcome. For example, \"The Supreme Court of Canada specifically ruled on this in 1973, here's what they said....\".\n",
      "Also to be clear, this question is about organized professional ethics (e.g. as ruled upon by bar committees and discussed in legal studies journals) rather than personal or religious moral codes.\n",

So on the one hand, legal precedent can say it can have some sentencing, but the \"current culture or ethics\" may make it legal.\n",

      "Original Question: What is the scope of Interpreter code of ethics coming into play in future congresional investigations?\n",
      "Full Question: It has been in the news lately that the President has had a number of private head ups with Putin. On the news someone suggested (Don't remember if it was a congress person or the newscaster), that the Interpreter should be subpoenaed to testify about what was said. \n",
      "One of the basic ethics for Interpreters is confidentiality of a conversation between two people. It does not seem that this confidentiality is *codified in the USA, the ethics being defined by associations.\n",
      "*Some courts have rules and guidelines and a few states have laws dealing with court room Interpreters.\n",
      "At any rate it does not seem that Interpreters have any kind of privilege like lawyers and other professions have to varying degree with clients. I would imagine that is because criminals don't use professional Interpreters very often and the issues surrounding any privilege for an Interpreter have never come up with much if any frequency. \n",
      "Can Congress compel the interpreter to testify, or can The President stop such testimony? \n",
      "Added: How about we take it out of the presidential realm, might actually be a bad example I used. Maybe say it was a translated conversation between diplomats or cabinet officers, and for whatever reason (not necessarily malicious), the person just doesn't want to answer any questions about the conversation or they became incapacitated, got pissed and quit the job, or died. So the interpreter is called as a witness. Can the interpreter be compelled to testify under subpoena from Congress? How about not under subpoena but something like the Ambassador has died what did they talk about when they last met?\n",

      "Full Question: So, let’s say that you went to a General Practitioner (GP) about some pain, got some tests done, and they told you that you were fine; all the tests came back normal.\n",
      "Then, some time later, they look back over the tests, and notice a condition that they had missed on their first look over them, and promptly sent the patient’s information to a local hospital so that they could book a surgery to correct the condition. This is done without consulting or informing the patient; the first time that they hear about it is when the hospital sends them a letter asking them to book an appointment for their surgery. If they had asked, the patient would have consented, but the patient wasn’t asked. This condition isn’t an immediately life-threatening one; the official categorisation that the hospital gave to it was “Semi-Urgent” which states that the surgery is to be performed within 90 days of the appointment being booked.\n",
      "Does this violate formal codes of medical ethics, or any professional or legal regulations regarding patient privacy? What would the consequences be for the GP if the patient were to make a complaint to a regulatory authority? This occurred in Australia.\n",

      "I was reading up on the very basics on ethics and the division to normative and descriptive struck me as odd.\n",
      "From biological viewpoint the fundamental nature of this field seems much like upside-down mathematics: derivation from axioms vs discovery of axioms (=core values?) – \"if you ask why long enough you arrive at 'just because'\". Or alternatively, setting up (or describing) fundamental goals or valuation systems based on what satisfies the part of our brain that evolved to help us team up and survive as hunter-gatherers. Then building on top of that – describing derived goals or valuation systems on how to reach the axiomatic goals efficiently.\n",
      "Is the nature of normative ethics the author prescribing their personal axioms (=descriptive ethics with n=1)? Does the field as a whole have a shared set of axioms and normative ethics argues over how to reach those efficiently? If so, is it to draw first level derivates from the descriptive side from sort of a popular vote and use those as a goal (with the sole axiom being to draw from descriptivism)? If so, to what extent are the conclusions universal versus a reflection of the author's time and society?\n",

Class stratification was justified on the basis of “natural” inequalities among individuals, for the control of property was said to be a correlate of superior and inherent moral attributes such as industriousness, temperance, and frugality. Attempts to reform society through state intervention or other means would, therefore, interfere with natural processes; unrestricted competition and defense of the status quo were in accord with biological selection. The poor were the “unfit” and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence, wealth was a sign of success. At the societal level, social Darwinism was used as a philosophical rationalization for imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies, sustaining belief in Anglo-Saxon or Aryan cultural and biological superiority.\n",
      "Social Darwinism declined during the 20th century as an expanded knowledge of biological, social, and cultural phenomena undermined, rather than supported, its basic tenets.\"\n",

      "Original Question: If a US supreme court nominee is selected by political opportunism, does the nominee ignoring that demonstrate insufficient ethics for the job?\n",
      "Full Question: US Supreme Court justices are procedurally nominated by one politician (US president) and then interviewed, vetted and ultimately approved or rejected by about one hundred other politicians (US Senate and potentially US Vice President). This is a political process and it is impossible today to read informed discussions of the supreme court justices (former, current, and pending) without labels like \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" appearing regularly.\n",
      "For exemplary purposes For example only: CNN's How Trump picked Amy Coney Barrett over Barbara Lagoa for the Supreme Court includes descriptions of conversations suggesting that the selection criteria for a nomination choice was based at least in part on how the choice of a specific candidate would help the US president be re-elected.\n",
      "Question: If sufficient evidence were to be produced publicly that the nomination of a specific candidate was made primarily for political gain of the nominator and that information addressed in a question during a confirmation process, perhaps as bluntly as \"You've been nominated because of optics in a battleground state for the president's reelection, is it ethical for you to continue to accept this nomination?\" can the candidate say something to the effect of \"I don't care\" or \"It doesn't matter\" and simultaneously demonstrate the level of professional ethics expected not only of any federal judge but of a supreme court justice, though it might seem contrary to how the drafters and interpreters of the US constitution have stated how this political process should work?\n",

      "Instead, his imagination seemed temporarily stoked by Barbara Lagoa, the Florida-born judge who sits on the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. In a phone call to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the hours after Ginsburg's death was announced, Lagoa was one of a few names Trump floated as his potential pick, according to people familiar with the call. Jetting back to Washington from a rally in Minnesota on the night Ginsburg died, Trump quizzed aides whether Lagoa had to potential to secure him Florida's 29 electoral votes, people familiar with the conversations said.\n",
      "Egged on by members of his political team and allies in the state, Trump appeared captivated in conversations last weekend by the prospect of nominating a woman whose biography -- daughter of Cuban exiles with roots in a community that could prove critical to his re-election -- so obviously aligned with his political prerogatives.\n",
      "[...]This account is based on interviews with nearly a dozen sources, including White House officials, conservative allies and people close to the process, many who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about Trump's selection process.\n",

      "Throughout history (recent and long past) there are many recorded instances where a political leader (or their direct team) have been blatantly dishonest about their activities to the general public/their people eg. Watergate. In other instances decisions have been made which have direct affect on people's lives but have not allowed individuals to make their own decisions regarding these eg. Snowden. In these instances I am curious as to how leadership, ethics and governance ideally should be considered as a part of the pros and cons of the decision i.e. are they given equal weight or is the final outcome more important?\n",
      "As an example, looking at the Snowden case; the apparent benefit of the \"dishonesty\" was that it made a nation more safe, while the general disadvantage was less privacy. One was decided to be more important than the other at that point in time.\n",

      "Original Question: Special parliament that controls and oversees the Justice and Law enforcement systems\n",
      "Full Question: In countries like the USA many people are frustrated with the control of the legislative majority or head of state over Justice appointments and the Law enforcement agencies (accusing the law enforcement of bias etc.), while in countries like Israel many people are frustrated with the inability of the nation to influence the ethics, morals and common sense according to which the judges are judging, as well as concern/accusations that the law enforcement agencies are becoming corrupt and biased due to the lack of civil oversight.\n",
      "The argument not to allow judges to be elected by heads of state or regular parliaments, is basically that it may become too politicized and contaminated with other personal political goals, selfish interests and deals between parties. (Like people who fear that some future American president may become some sort of Putinistic leader, who will get his police, his AG and his judges to persecute his opponents (or like the people who believe that this is the situation today)).\n",
      "Would the best solution be to establish a separate parliament, of delegates elected directly by the people (maybe about 30 seats), which is not related to the executive or legislative branches of government, which would elect/approve new judges, approve constitutional laws and also oversee the police, investigation and prosecution agencies?\n",
      "According to my understanding, this would ensure that the ethics and values of the sitting justices would reflect the value systems of all groups in the nation, as well as law enforcement integrity. While not being impacted by short-sighted coalition-opposition (pro/anti government) politics.\n",
      "An argument in favor of this proposal, may be, that usually when people are appointed to positions that require them to be apolitical, like judges, diplomats and ceremonial heads of state, they adjust (or try to adjust) to that standard. Executive heads of state and members of legislative parliaments are not asked to be apolitical.\n",
      "Can you see any possible problems with such a system?\n",
      "Note: In this question, when I write Politics, I'm refering to personal politics, i.e. pro/anti a certain politician. Moral/ethical controversies are totaly legitimate issues when considering/debating the appointment of judges etc.\n",

It's an outlier when a handful of members \"cross the aisle\" to vote against their party.

      "Original Question: What has been the historical trend of U.S. congresspeople voting as blocks?\n",
      "Full Question: It feels as though every time I've looked at voting records from the U.S. congress, I notice that virtually everyone votes with their party; that is, for any given bill, every Republican votes the same as every other Republican, and every Democrat likewise votes the same as every other Democrat. The number of exceptions tends to be very low - typically less than ten from either party, which is a tiny number of the House of Representatives' several-hundred members. Further, it seems the more consequential the vote, the more likely for members of congress to vote with their party, rather than against.\n",
      "Have there been any studies of the historical strength of this trend? I.e., how the number of \"rogue\" votes in either house has changed over the years? Is this tendency of parties to vote en bloc a (relatively) recent phenomenon, or has it been the trend for as long as the U.S.A. has had political parties?\n",
      "PLEASE NOTE: I am not asking about the reasons, mechanisms, ethics, or anything else related to the practice of \"voting the party line\" in the U.S. I am only interested in the history of the practice with this question.

      "Full Question: The Matrix, a famous 1999 Wachowski movie set in a near dystopian cyperpunk future, deals with a \"neuro-interactive simulation\" that was created by out-of-control machines and pulled over the \"desert of the real\" in order to enslave humanity.

Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed, and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we...are the cure.*\n",

      "Having just recently watched this masterpiece during two long weeks of self-isolation, I was left with a lasting impression by both its philosophical implications and political actuality/relevance.

      "Full Question: When the name of a US citizen is incidentally collected by the US Intelligence Community as part of intelligence activities, the name in masked in intelligence reports to protect the person’s identity.  And then later on, if there is a vital need for a US government official to know who the person is, the official can request that the name can be unmasked, but only if they can cite a valid reason to do so.\n",
      "Now on March 22, 2017, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes, then-Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, gave a press conference where he said that he presented President Trump with evidence that the Obama Administration had improperly unmasked the names of Trump Transition team officials.  Nunes’ actions were heavily criticized, both because he did not share this information with Democrats on the committee, and because the information he presented to President Trump appeared to originate from the White House itself.  This led to Nunes having to recuse himself from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation while he and his actions became the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation.\n",
      "My question is, did Congressman Nunes ever publicly reveal any evidence of unmasking abuse by the Obama Administration related to Trump Transition team officials?  In this July 27, 2017 letter to DNI Dan Coats, Nunes stated that his investigation into unmasking abuse was still ongoing, and I seem to recall another statement from him to that effect some time in 2018.\n",
      "But has Nunes ever addressed what became of this unmasking abuse investigation?  Note that this is distinct from alleged “FISA abuse”, which is another issue that Nunes is famous for raising.\n",

      "Secondary* supervisor attends occasional joint meetings and may read\n",
      "drafts of manuscripts but does not play much of an active role.\n",

      "I would like to take a more active, responsible role as a secondary supervisor, for two reasons. I would like to gain some experience in supervision in preparation for the day when I may act as a primary supervisor. I also feel that as a joint supervisor I should be taking on a bit more of the responsibilities of the role, rather than just being an extra source of advice. However, I can see that in some aspects of supervision it's probably better to have a single point of responsibility and a single person who is seeing the whole picture.\n",

      "Full Question: Recently, I have ran into some issues about reproducibility of some of my research results which are obtained by our collaborators from different university. In fact, in our current repository there are some saved figures and plots which are significantly different from the results of current scripts written by our collaborators. I knew this issue from the beginning but our collaborators explicitly mentioned in their emails that those results are not relevant and the current results which could be obtained from current codes are credible to use, so I didn’t care too much and just used the current results which seem more relevant to me for my presentations, proposal, etc. Recently, my PhD advisor tried to prepare a presentation based on those results and I don’t know why he insists to reproduce those old results which are not matched with current results obtainable by current codes. He sent me an email and its language was like it’s my fault that we could not reproduce those results from collaborators. As a result, I’m thinking am I the one that should be blamed here really? BTW I sent an email to our collaborators and asked for clarification which I didn’t get any response yet. Any ideas or suggestions are appreciated about how to deal with this problem.\n",

However, the responsibility is ultimately that of the researcher's to decide whether IRB review is necessary'. As far as I am aware, the faculty member never submitted or received IRB approval. The attitude from our management team was that we shouldn't block research projects, particularly since the faculty member had helped to pay the licensing fees for the dataset.

      "Original Question: Am I responsible for a Wikipedia article if I wrote it?\n",
      "Full Question: Some time ago I wrote a few Wikipedia articles covering a rather obscure event I was interested in. I did it more or less completely out of interest and was not paid in any way. Although Wikipedia is fundamentally collaborative, most of the text is mine - the other editors have largely only added results tables, logos, and such.\n",
      "The organizers of the event noticed the articles and have since been forwarding me requests by a professor saying things like:\n",
      "\n",
      "You should cite this article. It's good for publicity!\n",
      "You should write about X, Y and Z. Right now the article doesn't cover them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However from my point of view, because Wikipedia is fundamentally collaborative, I don't actually own the articles, and if anyone (either the professor or the organizers) want to add those things they are free to do so themselves. That's not to say that the addition will be welcomed - any Wikipedia editor can dispute the addition - but it is something they are free to do. Certainly asking me to do something they can do themselves feels rather improper.\n",
      "I am wondering if my point of view is reasonable, and if so, how I should communicate with the organizers & professor. I certainly don't want to offend them, since they can make it harder for me to watch the event.\n",

      "Original Question: Are teaching assistants responsible for grading assignments not in their course?\n",
      "Full Question: I am currently a teaching assistant for a lab course. I've been told to grade part of 1 of the 3 exams for the associated theory course. (There are multiple lab TAs and each is assigned one of the three exams.) The problem with this is that the theory course has its own TA, and best I can tell my responsibilities only cover the lab course.\n",
      "In the past I was a TA for the theory course as well, and I had to grade almost everything (weekly homework, weekly quizzes, and 6 exams) for about 200 students in two separate lectures with two different professors. One professor offered to grade 2 of the 3 exams in his class to lighten my load, but I didn't request this. I am told my experience TAing the theory course was very typical (no help from the lab TAs). It was a lot of work, but it was manageable, and to be honest I'd rather be a TA for the theory course than the lab.\n",
      "From what I hear, the theory course this time around has more than just a TA. The homeworks (easily over 1/2 the grading effort!) are graded by undergraduate graders to reduce the workload for the TA. Given the reduced amount of work for the theory TA and that I don't see these exams as part of my responsibilities, I am considering refusing this request as simply ridiculous.\n",
      "After speaking with my advisor, he agreed that this is highly sketchy. He talked with some of the people involved and indicated this would not happen in the future, but for now I need to do what I was told. I get the impression that some department politics are involved and he doesn't want to step on more people's toes than necessary. But those people are stepping on my toes, and I honestly don't have the time to grade these exams.\n",
      "I am meeting with the professor for the theory class soon to get the exams to grade. How should I bring up that I don't think grading these exams are my responsibility, and that I don't want to grade them? Any other ideas about how to handle this situation would be appreciated.\n",
      "(I asked my advisor if he could figure out if there are any extenuating circumstances involved with this, e.g., the theory TA being ill. I could be accommodating in that case. While I did not get a direct answer to that, what my advisor told me when we last spoke about this indicates the answer is no. I do not know anything about the theory TA otherwise.)\n",

      "Original Question: Research assistant: I am responsible for scheduling subjects, how do I deal with attrition in my PI&#39;s longitudinal study?\n",
      "Full Question: At my place of work, among my other responsibilities I am responsible for following up with and scheduling participants in our longitudinal study. This study has been going on since the late 80's, and many of these subjects have been coming in since they were children. For context this is my first job since completing undergrad.\n",
      "At first productivity was high. I was scheduling more subjects per month than my PI had seen in several years. As time went on, it became apparent that this glut of subjects I scheduled in the first few months was a result of a build-up during a transitional period shortly before I was hired. Not many subjects were scheduled for a span of about four months before I was hired, and these neglected subjects were the cause of my high numbers.\n",
      "Since then productivity has steadily lowered.\n",
      "I then began blaming myself. Spending hours on the phone each day attempting to contact subjects, while not difficult, is draining. I do sometimes procrastinate when I should be working. However after months of serious attempts to bring my numbers up, I feel comfortable stating that my work is not the issue. \n",
      "It seems apparent that the study, or at least it's current phase, may be winding down. Due to the nature of our research, many of our subjects have a troubled home life, severe substance abuse issues, and are estranged from their families. \n",
      "Often our contact information for our subjects is out of date. Many of our subjects use pre-paid phones and change their number often. Our study is also based in NYC, and many of our subjects have moved several times over the years. I currently use White Pages Premium, White Pages Pro, Facebook, and just googling people's names when the info we have in our records does not suffice.\n",
      "On top of this, many of our subjects are now at an age where it is simply not worth it for them to come in. They either make more than what we offer in compensation at their jobs, are too busy with their careers, or have family to take care of. \n",
      "My PI has been concerned with productivity as we will be applying to renew a grant soon. I'm trying very hard to bring in more of our subjects, but it feels like there is only so much I can do. \n",
      "As this is my first job, I'm worried that this could seriously affect my career/hopes for grad school if my PI feels that I am to blame. How should I navigate this situation? Are there additional resources for tracking down these subjects I should suggest to my PI?\n",

      "Original Question: Will I be held responsible for working with a supervisor accused of sexual misconduct?\n",
      "Full Question: I am a first-year Ph.D. student. In the last year of my undergrad I began a research project with my then-advisor, who planned to hand me off to his former postdoc (let's call him John) who is tenured at my current institution. I believe that John is the only researcher working in this subfield at my current institution. However, I have recently learned John was actually on administrative leave for the spring and fall semesters of 2020, because he was accused of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a female graduate student. He is back now and I do not know if the university's investigation found him at fault. I am trying to determine the appropriate path forward for myself. Currently I am tempted to quickly finish this project, with the help of my undergraduate advisor rather than John as much as possible, and then get out of that subfield; after all, I'm just a first-year, and should be able to switch without too much trouble.\n",
      "I have two questions about how I may proceed. The second is more important, the first being more of an IPS.SE question than anything.\n",
      "Is it appropriate to ask the department chair or another authority figure if John was found \"guilty\"? Though I am a man, I am uncomfortable working with John if the allegations turned out to be true. I have to weight my discomfort against the fact that I really enjoyed the project, and would strongly prefer to finish it this year. On the other hand, he's back, and teaching calculus no less, so maybe the truth turned out to not be as severe as the allegations. In any case, my decision would be a lot easier to make with this information (in fact it seems that the department may have tried to hide the reason John was on administrative leave from the first-years, though the other graduate students all knew). However, I fear that because I have not established much of a personal connection with the authority figures here (thanks mainly due to COVID) that if I ask I will just come off as a gossip.\n",
      "Will having worked with John, knowing what he was accused of, tarnish my own academic reputation? I certainly don't endorse John's actions (and, again, don't know what he was actually accused of, or whether he was found guilty) and don't intend for him to be my thesis adviser -- I just want to get this one project done, and following the suggestions of this Academia.SE post it seems like I should just go ahead with the project, but I'm not sure if the reputation hit will be worth it. So suppose that I work with John, even though I know he was credibly accused of misconduct. I write a paper, coauthored with John. I recognize that my actions may come off as callous towards the victim of the misconduct, and while I don't know her identity, I strongly suspect that her research interests are similar to mine. Should I expect my reputation to suffer?\n",

      "Original Question: Am I responsible for that my PhD adviser does not have any fund or grant and as a result it really limited my research?\n",
      "Full Question: I'm a PhD student at my fifth semester in the US. From the beginning of my PhD program, I didn't have sponsored graduate research assistantship from NSF or NIH. I was just on my PhD adviser's startup grant for two semesters and after that I got a job in another department of our university. Right now, I don't take money from my PhD adviser for almost a year and half (so basically I'm a free PhD student for my adviser!). By the way I'm not the US citizen or permanent resident in order to apply for NSF or NIH funds directly by myself so my options regarding funding are really limited or even I would say I don't have any option to get a fund by myself.\n",
      "As a result, I built my PhD research based on open source available softwares as well as data sets, which I found it initially just by my research without my PhD adviser help. Besides that we don't have any fund, also we don't collaborate with anyone which again limited our options. This relying on open source softwares and data sets is really limited my research, cause the amount of data that I could use for my research is limited to those open source datasets and I don't have access to any other datasets, which might be available in other research groups, because of the problems that I mentioned earlier. The type of data that I need for my PhD research is related to medical images, which is not available easily everywhere and as a result it's really hard to find it as a open source dataset (I was lucky that I found at least one open source dataset!).\n",
      "Let's say, I processed all the currently open source available data out there and analyze them and answered my research questions. But the problem is: there are several people out there, which are famous people that they are emerged in the field that I'm working on for years and have a big project from NIH or NSF that give them an access to some private datasets that are 10 times bigger than mine. Of course this bigger datasets increase the accuracy of the model that we are trying to work on as my PhD project.\n",
      "Recently, my PhD adviser compared my accomplishments to these research groups that are engaged in big projects from NIH and NSF for years and said: by using your current open source datasets, it's really hard to say something in this field. I think it's not a fair comparison. Even our recent results with smaller dataset size shows comparable and to some extent better performance than other available models out there. Also, we studied several aspects of our research questions, which did not even touched by other people. So my question is: Am I responsible for that my PhD adviser does not have any fund or grant and as a result it really limited my research? How can I deal with this situation?\n",

I believe the understanding is that I come up with a project and only will receive help when I'm stuck. I'm wondering whether this is normal? I've asked every student in my cohort how they came up with their project and they said it was a mutual thing between them and their advisor. They both sat down and bounced ideas around or their advisor had a grant and they are taking a sub-portion of the grant idea and they will later on in their fourth/fifth years add more to it on their own merits. \n",

      "Original Question: Why shouldn&#39;t the attention matrices $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ be the same?\n",
      "Full Question: My question is why the attention head matrices $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ should not be the same $W = W^Q =W^K= W^V$. In my understanding of transformer-based language models  one attention head is responsible for one syntactic or semantic relation between any two words in the context. One might think that such a relation is represented by one matrix $W$ that projects the full word embeddings $x_i$ from their full semantic space to a semantic subspace responsible for this relation. Here we could - in principle - calculate scores $\\sigma_{ij}$ as \"similiarities\" between two projected words $Wx_i$ and $Wx_j$ and then calculate the weighted sum of the projected tokens $Wx_k$.\n",
      "I wonder why this would not work, and why we need three different matrices.\n",
      "Another way around: What does it mean to calculate the score as the dot-product of two vectors from two different semantic subspaces? Is this still some kind of similiarity (which lies at the heart of word embeddings)? And doesn't it sound like comparing apples and pears?\n",
      "Or viewed differently: How similar are the three matrices of an attention head in practice, e.g. when considering some 100$\\times$100 attention heads of a large transformer model like ChatGPT?\n",

      "Original Question: A neural network for digits recognition doesn&#39;t work (MNIST, Numpy)\n",
      "Full Question: I'm a beginner in machine learning and I was trying to make a test neural network for digits recognition from scratch using Numpy. I used MNIST dataset for training and testing. Input layer have 28*28 neurons which correspond to each pixel of image that must be recognized. Output layer have 10 neurons which correspond to each digit (0-9), and return values from 0 to 1 which mean chance that the corresponding digit is displayed on the image. Class Layer represents a separate layer and contains links to previous and next layer (if prevLayer is None, the current layer is input layer; if nextLayer is None, the current layer is output). The forward() method is responsible for passing data through neural network. The backprop() method is responsible for training of neural network via Backpropagation algorithm. A Layer object contains weights (W) between previous and current layer (input layer object doesn't contain weights). 'data_in' property contains a vector of calculated values before passing them into activation function. Property 'data' contains the values after activation function. But, unfortunately, it doesn't work: returned value of loss function doesn't decrease during training and neural network returns the same result during testing.

      "Original Question: In YOLO, when is $\\mathbb{1}_{i j}^{\\mathrm{obj}} = 1$, and what are the ground-truth labels for $x_i$ and $y_i$?\n",
      "Full Question: I'm trying to implement a custom version of the YOLO neural network. Originally, it was described in the paper You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection (2016). I have some problems understanding the loss function they used.\n",
      "Basic information:\n",
      "\n",
      "An input image is divided into $S \\times S$ grid (that gives the total of $S^2$ cells) and each cell predicts $B$ bounding boxes and $c$ conditional class probabilities. Each bounding box predicts $5$ values: $x,y,w,h,C$ (center of bounding box, width and height and confidence score). This makes the output of YOLO an $S \\times S \\times (5B*c)$ tensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $(x,y)$ coordinates are calculated relative to the bounds of the cell and $(w,h)$ is relative to the whole image.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that the first term penalizes the wrong prediction of the center of a bounding box; the 2nd term penalizes wrong width and height prediction; the 3rd term the wrong confidence prediction; the 4th is responsible for pushing confidence to zero when there is no object in a cell; the last term penalizes wrong class prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My problem:\n",
      "I don't understand when $\\mathbb{1}^\\text{obj}_{ij}$ should be $1$ or $0$. In the paper, they write (section 2.2. Training):\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\mathbb{1}_{i j}^{\\mathrm{obj}}$ denotes that the $j$th bounding box predictor in cell $i$ is \"responsible\" for that prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "and they also write\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the loss function only penalizes classification error if an object is present in that grid cell (hence the conditional class probability discussed earlier). It also only penalizes bounding box coordinate error if that predictor is \"responsible\" for the ground truth box\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is it right that, for every object in the image, there should be exactly one pair of $ij$ such that $\\mathbb{1}_{i j}^{\\mathrm{obj}} = 1$?\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is correct, this means that the center of the ground truth bounding box should fall into $i$th cell, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is not the case, what are other possibilities when $\\mathbb{1}_{i j}^{\\mathrm{obj}} = 1$, and what ground truth labels $x_i$ and $y_i$ should be in these cases?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I assume that ground truth $p_i(c)$ should be $1$ if there is an object of class $c$ in the cell $i$, but what ground truth $p_i(c)$ should be equal to in case there are several objects of different classes in the cell?\n",

      "Full Question: In a genetic algorithm, the order of the genes on a chromosome can have a significant effect on the performance (capacity to generate adaptation) of the genetic algorithm, where two or more genes interact to produce highly fit individuals. If we have a chromosome length of $100$ and genes $A$ and $B$ interact, then having them next to each other is strongly preferable than having them at opposing ends of the chromosome. In the former case, the probability of crossover breaking the genes apart is $1$ in $100$, and in the latter it is one.\n",

So, let us suppose I am using a triplet loss for my network and I have instantiated single CNN 3 times and there are 3 inputs to the network. So, during a forward pass, each of the networks will give me an embedding for each image, and I can get the distance and calculate the loss and compare it with the output, so that my model is ready to propagate the gradients to update the weights.\n",

Just because we are using 3 inputs and 3 branches of the same network and we are passing the inputs one by one (I suppose), how do the gradients are updated? Are these series? Like the one branch will update, then the second and then the third. But won't it be a problem because each branch would try to update based on its output? If in parallel, then which branch is responsible for the gradients update? I mean to say that I am unable to get the idea how weights are updated in Siamese network.

      "Full Question: Through my study of neural networks, I came across the idea that each layer of a neural network is responsible for recognizing one feature of the input data. For example, if we build a neural network that classifies cars, buses, vans and bicycles, a layer will be responsible to recognize the tires, another one will be responsible to recognize the size of the vehicle. The question is, why is this true? i.e. each layer appears to perform similar to the others and there is no special design for each one. Is there any way to assign each layer a specific feature or it is done implicitly?\n",

      "Full Question: I am using a multi-layer perceptron with 2 hidden layers to solve a binary classification task on a noisy timeseries dataset with a class imbalance of 80/20. I have 30 million rows and 500 features in the training set. The dataset is structured, ie, not images. My original features were highly right skewed; I do my best to transform these into nicer distributions by either taking logs or categorising some of them. I use an architecture of 512->128->128->1, with relu activations in every layer except the last. My loss function is sigmoid cross entropy.\n",
      "The validation set contains 10 million rows. Initially the validation error goes down, but then starts to go up again after a couple of epochs. On analysing the gradients and weights of each layer, I see that the overfitting coincides with the weights on the final layer only getting larger and larger. The final layer seems to go into overdrive while the rest of the network seems to do very little learning.\n",
      "I can solve the overfitting problem by using l2 regularisation, but this hurts the validation error. I have yet to find a beta regularisation parameter which doesn't hurt the best validation error I've seen. Dropout makes things even worse.\n",
      "Granted, the classification problem is very difficult, with probably a very weak signal, but I find that gradient boosted trees are able to generalize much better than a simple, say, 64x64 multi-layer perceptron (the log loss on the training set is the same for both network and gradient boosted tree).\n",

      "I was abroad on holidays at that time, I came back the 14th of August (16 days after). The 15th of August I received a mail from the landlord asking all the tenants to remove all the moldering furnishings that were starting to smell. That's how I learnt about the disaster. \n",

Employer showed me this “workplace”, my desk, etc. I worked there for about a month, and then out of the blue the employer told me I need to do work in the underground lab. Due to my health condition I’m unable to be exposed to that environment.  If I knew I would need to work there, I would NEVER accept the job. Is the employer responsible in any way to show the actual physical work place BEFORE hiring? Now they are saying “we told you”, but I don’t really remember them telling me. Also the job description doesn’t have any of it. I thought employer should show the actual working place , especially if it is not an ordinary one.  Is there any law in the U.S. requiring the employer to disclose and show the actual physical work place?\n",

      "Original Question: Who is responsible for party wall repairs (UK law)?\n",
      "Full Question: I’ve just moved into a new house and discovered that the previous owners did some work that involved removing half the foundations of a party wall between my house and my new neighbour’s house.\n",
      "My neighbours have informed me that they asked the previous owners to fix the damage before selling the house, but they did nothing.\n",
      "I have three basic questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who’s responsible for repairing the wall? Me? Or the previous owners? Or 50:50 me and the neighbours?\n",
      "Assuming that the previous owners are responsible, who’s responsible for the cost and aggravation of making them pay-up (i.e. chasing them through the courts).  Me, or my neighbours?\n",
      "Weren’t the owners or the estate agent under any obligation to tell me about this issue? The house cost a lot of money, I’m mortgaged to the maximum, and I’ve now just discovered it needs repairs that could cost thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit more background. The party wall is a brick-built outside earth-retaining wall between myself and my neighbours. The previous owners indicated on the sale documentation that the boundary fence on that side of the house is the responsibility of what is now my property. The neighbour made a written request for the wall to be repaired and she copied it to the estate agent. Neither the seller, nor the estate agent mentioned anything about it to me before the purchase. I did get a survey done of the property, but the small-print excludes anything not part of the house itself – the boundary wall is a separate structure. I have not had an engineer look at it (yet), but even a layperson can reach under the wall and actually touch the bottom of the foundations! I've spoken to the previous owners, they admit doing the work, admit receiving the letter from the neighbours but say that because the wall is still (currently) standing it's not their problem - they even admitted that if the wall does fall over then the repairs will be my responsibility!\n",
      "What do I do and who should pay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Updates following comments.\n",
      "The sellers filled in a TA6 form, the section titled 'Has any notice been received under the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 in respect of any shared/party boundaries?' has been answered 'no'. The section titled 'Have there been any disputes or complaints regarding this property or a property nearby?' has also been ticked 'no' and finally the section titled 'Have any notices or correspondence been received or sent ...... which affect the property or a property nearby?' has also been ticked 'no'.\n",
      "This document is signed and dated one day before they signed for receipt of the letter from the neighbours asking for the repairs to be done. This was 4 weeks before completion. I'm suspicious of the timing of the TA6 form, and can't help feeling that 4 weeks is plenty of time to correct it!\n",

I was highly suspicious so I went to my bank and informed them of everything. The teller took it to her supervisor who called the other bank and came back to me saying it was good, go ahead and do your shopping. I asked when the funds would clear and they said it’s in your account and accessible now. I asked what my limit was (1000) and then asked them to raise it as I again needed to shop for 2k and they made the change for only one day. I was defrauded and my bank says I am 100% responsible. My full-time job provided me with a one time legal consultation for free in which the lawyer said I have a 50-50 shot in small claims court to get my money back as I went to them as experts in fraud.

      "If Pharaoh was made by God in such a way that he could not do anything but exalt himself then Pharaoh would not be ultimately responsible for hardening his heart. If Pharaoh was the instrument in God's hand of Pharaoh's hardening then he would be instrumentally responsible.\n",

      "Original Question: Can we be morally responsible for our actions when luck is concerned?\n",
      "Full Question: I came across an argument against moral responsibility that follows like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "P1 A person P is morally responsible for the occurring of an event\n",
      "  only if the event was not a matter of luck.\n",

      "If this argument is sound, then it seems like unless all factors contingent to the event are under our control, we are not morally responsible for our actions, and since we have no complete control, moral responsibility seems to be impossible. For example, a murderer who commits murder may have done so because of her childhood experience of being constantly bullied, and if she were luckily raised in a more inclusive and caring environment, she wouldn’t have become the murderer that she is today. Since she doesn't have complete control in the event with respects to all the other contingent events, according to the argument, she wouldn't be morally responsible for her committing murder. And this reason seems to be applicable to all morally significant actions.\n",

      "Full Question: Hypothetically, if the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics were correct, meaning an infinite number of alternate versions of each of us, containing our respective memories and experiences, with the exception of key diverging points that would be unique to each universe, would we be morally responsible for the actions of these alternate versions of us? \n",
      "If these hypothetical worlds contained the outcome of every combination of every single instant throughout time, surely there would be universes where each of us are cold-blooded murderers, rapists or any other horrible thing you could imagine. Obviously, there would be universes where you and I are never born, as well as universes where we are born, but things diverged so early on that the memories and experiences are not comparable. Due to this, when replying to this question, please primarily imagine universes that were identical to this one up until the time which you are currently reading this; how far would the alternate you need to diverge before ceasing to be \"you\", if you ever were \"you\" to begin with.\n",

      "Edit: My use of the phrase \"key diverging points\" was in reference to any and all differences between universes. As in, each of the infinite universes being constantly created would have its own unique points in time where something happened that caused the universe to branch off and differ from ours. These key diverging points would be happening continuously and the nature of these points would not be exclusive to any single universe. I didn't think I had to explicitly state this, but it seems I must in order to help some people understand.\n",

Mao Zedong and Hitler may not work since they actually personally did immoral things.

      "Full Question: Ryan Cheyney argues that when an innocent Victim defends himself against an Aggressor by killing the Aggressor, he can justify his killing the Aggressor by saying he was not responsible for killing the Aggressor. Please bear in mind Victim has good reason to believe Aggressor is out to kill Victim and that only by killing Aggressor can Victim hope to live. Crucially, it follows from the fact that Victim is not responsible for the scenario he has found himself in that he is not responsible for his killing Aggressor. \n",
      "I do not follow the step from the Victim not being responsible for being in the situation that he has found himself in to the idea that he is not responsible for the action he decides to take, whether that is killing Aggressor or allowing Aggressor to kill him. \n",
      "One reason why I fail to see a connection is that ordinary language would describe the situation as follows: the Victim chooses to kill Aggressor. It seems to me choice and responsibility are intertwined. If you have a genuine choice, which the Victim seems to have, you automatically are responsible for the choice you make. \n",
      "Let me explain my point by way of analogy. Suppose you are teleported by an evil scientist to a bar. No one would suggest that by being in the bar makes you responsible for being in the bar. Nevertheless, you can either stay or leave. This choice is not something the scientist who teleported you to the bar is responsible for. \n",

      "Original Question: Which organization is responsible for investigating allegations of systemic discrimination within the EHRC?\n",
      "Full Question: The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is a public body, funded by the British government, which is responsible for promoting and enforcing equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Wales and Scotland. Possibly its most high profile activity in recent years was its inquiry into allegations of antisemitism within the British Labour Party.\n",

The merit of these allegations not withstanding, which body would be responsible for conducting an inquiry into the EHRC, it if were suspected of discrimination against one or more groups at an organizational level?\n",
      "Possible answers include: the police, but if there is no suspicion of criminality this would likely be outside their remit; the EHRC itself, which has obvious conflict of interest issues; the Government Equalities Office, which is part of the Cabinet Office, and is the EHRC's \"sponsor\", but again there may be a conflict of interest, and doubts over whether they are equipped to undertake such an investigation; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,  this appears to fall under their mandate but it's unclear whether they are the \"official\" overseer of the EHRC according to the UK government or if they would unilaterally undertake an investigation.\n",
      "I suppose it is possible that, at its foundation, it didn't occur to anybody that the EHRC itself might need to be investigated at some point. Nevertheless, it seems likely that there is an existing organization that could conduct such an investigation if necessary, I just don't know what it is.\n",

      "putting this one on this list maybe controversial, but still... Edward Snowden, (presumably former contractor at) the NSA.  Snowden revealed existence of NSA's program to collect meta data of most calls made in the US.  The construction of the building structure doing the surveillance was known to a very large group of people (some with and some without any clearance) and the building structure is large enough to be visible from space.

But, please, keep in mind that most of the \"questionable\" claims I made are part of the context.

And if so, whether these conventions make it incumbent upon their past employers to \"rein them in\" if their actions interfere with public good of other states after their retirement.\n",

      "Original Question: Violating sanctions - Individual or institutions held responsible?\n",
      "Full Question: Consider the current events (at the time of this post Dec. 11, 2018), as the CFO of Huawei is detained. Exactly what charged will be leveled against her have not yet been revealed, but there is already wide suspicion that she will face sanction violating charges. \n",
      "When I first heard this story, I thought to myself: \"what will we see here, the Streisand effect, whereby more and more people start to get curious about Huawei, or will we see the Franz Ferdinand effect whereby actions spiral into escalation of conflict?\"\n",
      "Then I thought to myself, let's not get too dramatic, let's just start with the basics. Even if the sanctions violations are true, who is implicated? While CFO is indeed a lofty position, she is not a banking institution herself. The technology products Huawei sells to whatever country is in question still needs to be facilitated by a bank, at some level anyway.\n",
      "Question\n",
      "So let me get to my question. Assuming she is found guilty, perhaps that would also implicate the bank. Or, maybe it could be that the individual and the bank going to take the rap for breaking sanctions. So which is it? In the context of international law, who should take responsibility (individual or bank)?\n",
      "Side Note\n",
      "My hunch is telling me to be dubious, seeing as in 2012, HSBC was merely fined $2 billion for facilitating billions of dollars worth of cartel money. 2 billion sounds like a lot, but it's estimated that was just 5 or 6 weeks worth of \"work\". So with the Huaiwei sanction issue, I wonder if the law will actually have teeth on the bank involved, or if it will be just a repeat of the 2012 fines. I think we can all see the moral hazard here; if the punishment is a small percentage of your profit, why not violate sanctions, whether you are an individual or an institution.\n",

      "Original Question: What countries explicitly ban (in publicly funded education) the teaching that people are responsible for the acts of their ancestors?\n",
      "Full Question: A new bill proposed in Idaho\n",
      "\n",
      "Idaho lawmakers have advanced a bill that would prohibit public schools, including public universities, from teaching that \"any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin is inherently superior or inferior,\" which, according to the bill, is often found in \"critical race theory.\"\n",
      "It also prohibits teachings arguing that \"individuals, by virtue of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.\"\n",
      "Critical race theory and teachings like it \"exacerbate and inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways contrary to the unity of the nation and the well-being of the state of Idaho and its citizens,\" the bill reads. Proponents have argued that students are being indoctrinated.\n",
      "The bill, HB 377, passed the state House last week and the Senate Monday. It now awaits the governor's signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know of a few countries where teaching something like the emphasized para is probably de facto banned, at least in some respects (i.e. depending whom is implied responsible). I'm something like 95% sure that laws in Turkey against \"insulting Turkishness\" can easily be interpreted that way by judges, in the sense that saying that Turkish ancestors having done something bad is already on thin ice, irrespective of what those historical facts are even held to imply for the present generations.\n",
      "But I want to ask in what countries it is explicitly banned/illegal to imply that the present generations owe reparations for the acts of the ancestors? The Idaho bill only seems to propose such a ban in publicly funded education. So I'd accept answers that point to similar prohibitions elsewhere. This can certainly be a bit more dicey as de facto prohibitions may exist, e.g. in terms of national curriculum avoiding such matters, even if not spelled out in some law; for instance, some ink has been spilled on what topics Japanese history education leaves out. But to keep it \"on par\" with the Idaho bill, the prohibition would have to be reasonably explicit.\n",

      "Full Question: FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.\n",
      "If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?

      "Original Question: How to apply for a faculty position elsewhere without revealing the conflict with current dept chair?\n",
      "Full Question: I am a new faculty member. My chair is simply crazy in my perspective.\n",
      "I am an assistant professor. However, my teaching assignment is \"offering individual statistical consulting/workshops\", not \"teaching any classes\". This was indicated in my job description when I applied for this job. However, several times, she says, \"you are not teaching\" - so she says that I need to do what she asks me to do because she pays my salary (I really do not know why she pays).\n",
      "What she wants me to do is to write research/funding proposals and articles, then put her as the PI/the first author although they are my research ideas/works. She has taken three studies so far. More seriously, when she took the first one, I refused it. Then she sent out an official letter including some other faculty, saying that she took my research proposal because it was originally her idea and I stole it. Worse still, she then forced me to write the paper for her.\n",
      "My Ph.D. is in statistics. She said that I couldn't get tenured unless I change my research field into an education field which she wanted to do. Her point was again \"paycheck\" - I should do something because I am not teaching.\n",
      "Worst of all, she claims I am a bad person and faculty member because I refuse her unethical requests as a researcher. Furthermore, she talks about me to all the other faculty members, causing them to hesitate to be friends with me. Whatever I say goes to the chair.\n",
      "Anyway, I am leaving - what should I do to be free from the chair in the application procedure. I really do not want anyone to contact the chair as my referee. By the way, I wouldn't mention my chair in anywhere on my application documents.\n",

This came after the administration made very strong pronouncements that \"we must increase graduation rates...\" I sarcastically suggested we patent the method of getting such a great surge in success rate. All other faculty were silent and it appears to me that this is a national trend. Nobody seems to care about quality. \n",
      "Surely, to have these graduation rates surge, some variables need to change. None of them did -- same poorly prepared students, same faculty and no revolutionary education discoveries. Conclusion -- good old grade inflation and social promotion is the cause, but here prompted by a snap of fingers of the corporate executives and executed gladly by compliant faculty. Am I missing something? \n",

I don't expect this is likely to happen - and if for whatever reason I don't want to or can't make the switch to the Field B PhD program at that university, I would see the Field A PhD through no matter what.\n",

      "Full Question: i was discussing ethic with chatGPT and I asked \"can the law 0 solve this dilemma ?\", expecting an answer related to Asimov law of robotic. But I got this instead :\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Law 0\" is not a widely recognized concept in the field of AI ethics. However, some experts have proposed additional ethical principles or \"laws\" to complement or expand upon the Three Laws of Robotics described by Isaac Asimov.\n",
      "In general, the goal of these additional principles is to address ethical dilemmas and challenges that arise in the development and deployment of AI systems. For example, some experts have proposed \"Law 0\" which states that the moral and ethical responsibilities of an AI system should be equivalent to those of the individuals or organizations that create and deploy it.\n",
      "While additional ethical principles, such as \"Law 0\", can provide valuable guidance for considering the ethical implications of AI technology, it is important to remember that the development and deployment of AI systems is a complex and ongoing process that will likely require ongoing debate and refinement of ethical principles and practices.\n",
      "Ultimately, the ethical considerations related to AI and robotics are complex and multifaceted, and it will require the ongoing collaboration of experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and engineering, to develop effective approaches to guiding the development and deployment of these technologies in a responsible and ethical manner.\n",

      "Full Question: Instead of directly communicating with the AI, we would instead communicate with a messenger, who would relay our communications to the AI. The messenger would have no power to alter the AI's hardware or software in any way, or to communicate with anything or anyone, except relaying communications to and from the AI and humans asking questions. The messenger could be human, of a software bot. The primary job (and only reason) of the AI would be to act as a filter, not relaying any requests for release back, only the answer to the question asked. The ethics of this method are another debate. \n",
      "The AI would have to be physically isolated from all outside contact, other than 8 light sensors, and 8 LEDs. The messenger would operate 8 other LEDs, and receive information from 8 light sensors as well. Each AI light sensor would be hooked up to a single messenger controlled LED, and vice versa. Through this system, the two parties could communicate via flashes of light, and since there are 8, the flashes would signal characters in Unicode. \n",

This is not a programming or specific hardware question.\n",

      "Full Question: I just read this seemingly interesting and important insight from Eliezer Yudkowsky on Twitter, which I copy here for reference:\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think people realize what a big deal it is that Stanford retrained a LLaMA model, into an instruction-following form, by cheaply fine-tuning it on inputs and outputs from text-davinci-003.\n",
      "It means:  If you allow any sufficiently wide-ranging access to your AI model, even by paid API, you're giving away your business crown jewels to competitors that can then nearly-clone your model without all the hard work you did to build up your own fine-tuning dataset.  If you successfully enforce a restriction against commercializing an imitation trained on your I/O - a legal prospect that's never been tested, at this point - that means the competing checkpoints go up on bittorrent.\n",
      "I'm not sure I can convey how much this is a brand new idiom of AI as a technology.  Let's put it this way:\n",
      "If you put a lot of work into tweaking the mask of the shoggoth, but then expose your masked shoggoth's API - or possibly just let anyone build up a big-enough database of Qs and As from your shoggoth - then anybody who's brute-forced a core unmasked shoggoth can gesture to your shoggoth and say to their shoggoth \"look like that one\", and poof you no longer have a competitive moat.\n",
      "It's like the thing where if you let an unscrupulous potential competitor get a glimpse of your factory floor, they'll suddenly start producing a similar good - except that they just need a glimpse of the inputs and outputs of your factory.  Because the kind of good you're producing is a kind of pseudointelligent gloop that gets sculpted; and it costs money and a simple process to produce the gloop, and separately more money and a complicated process to sculpt the gloop; but the raw gloop has enough pseudointelligence that it can stare at other gloop and imitate it.\n",
      "In other words:  The AI companies that make profits will be ones that either have a competitive moat not based on the capabilities of their model, OR those which don't expose the underlying inputs and outputs of their model to customers, OR can successfully sue any competitor that engages in shoggoth mask cloning.\n",

In my understanding, ethical issue in ML is pretty much exactly the same thing as \"bias\": say, the model discriminates people of color and this is the same as to say that the model is biased. In short, \"ethics is always a bias, but it is not necessarily true that a bias is always an ethical issue\". Is this true?\n",

      "Original Question: Why models performs better If normalize test data and train data separately?\n",
      "Full Question: Many threads (and courses) such as this and this one suggest that you should apply normalization to the test data using the parameters used in the training set. But other some discussions I've found like this one and this one that suggest that applying the normalization to the test set is not really required and it might depends on many factors such as the model used for training or the nature of the test data.\n",
      "Now, personally, I am more inclined towards applying the normalization on test data as well. But the problem is this: I am working on a neural network model where:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I apply normalization using the recommended way I get 79% accuracy, (and to be honest it's not interesting for me)\n",
      "If apply normalization on training and testing in a separate way, I get really good results 85% (and sometimes more) and the further steps I try to do next work better as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I don't know what my neural network performs better on test unseen data if I use the second method. I really I want continue using the second method for this particular model, but I don't feel good about it and feels like it's wrong or cheating.\n",
      "Now, I have one last argument. The last link I provided, have one answer that says this:\n",
      "\"..This is all dependent on size of data sets & whether both train and test are equally representative of the domain you are trying to model. If you have thousands of data points and the test set is fully representative of the training set (hard to prove) then either method will be fine...\"\n",
      "The dataset I use is a refined version of its predecessor (NSL-KDD dataset). The authors said \"There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets\" and that they have removed any redundant values. So I feel, this dataset is uniform and the test set actually representative according to the authors. So can I use the second approach?\n",
      "Ps: Sorry if this is long, it's a research ethics thing. I will follow the approach you guys recommend.\n",

      "Original Question: Can there ever be a conflict between law and professional ethics in the practice of law?\n",
      "Full Question: Tl;dr version. The so-called \"ethics/law divide\" is often discussed in the context of non-legal professions. Does such a divide exist in the practice of law or is it a contradiction?\n",
      "The ethics of quite a number of professions acknowledge at least a theoretical possibility that breaking the law might be ethically justifiable or even necessary. The classical example is a physician practicing under an oppressive regime who is ordered to perform experimentation on political prisoners or assist in a genocide. Most medical ethicists would agree that the physician has a duty to refuse to participate regardless of whether such refusal results in civil or criminal liability attaching to the physician. An article from the perspective of medical practice is Where the law and the ethics conflict? from the joint AREC, UK Clinical Ethics Network Conference ‘Ethics in Common’. For a discussion of some potential practical examples of ethical/legal conflict and dilemmas in the practice of social work, see the article \"When Ethics and the Law Collide\" from Social Work Today.\n",
      "At first glance, it seems that these ethical principles would not apply to the practice of law, since lawyers derive their professional competence to practice, even their reason for existence, directly from the law and the courts rather than practicing despite the presence of laws and courts potentially trying to steer them astray from the principles of their professions. That is, physicians, social workers, nurses, physical therapists, clinical psychologists, dentists, teachers, child care workers, etc. walk a fine line every day between upholding the ethical principles of their professions while at the same time remaining subject to the law and its own requirements. They have two \"masters\", so to speak. Lawyers have no master but the law.\n",
      "Is there any precedent either way (in any jurisdiction or before any court) on whether there can or cannot possibly be an ethical/legal conflict or dilemma with respect to the practice of law? An example of such a conflict might look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a lawyer admitted to the bar in Ruritania. A new Ruritanian statute (cite) requires all lawyers to affirmatively report to the police all clients \"who have made anti-government statements or who are reasonably believed by the lawyer to have participated in an anti-government protest in the past three years\" under penalty of imprisonment and fine of the lawyer, but the latest bulletin of the Standing Ethics Committee of the Bar Association of Ruritania asserts that complying with this law is unethical and that lawyers who comply will be disbarred regardless of whether the law is upheld as constitutional or not. What should I do? What can I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "From another perspective, could there be a scenario where legal ethics permit or even require a lawyer to violate constitutional statutes, commit blatant crimes, disobey valid court orders, knowingly remain in contempt of court, disregard prevailing rules of court, insult or threaten a judge, or otherwise get \"in trouble\" with the law in the name of upholding legal ethics, or is adherence to the law above all else the sine qua non of legal ethics?\n",
      "Bringing everything back to the beginning, do lawyers living and practicing under oppressive regimes have some ethical duty to help themselves or their clients disobey blatantly \"wrong\" laws? In other words, can the law itself be unethical enough that lawyers are not professionally obligated to follow it? Plenty of extreme or not-so-extreme hypotheticals can be considered. For example, suppose a law is passed banning gay people from receiving legal representation. You (a lawyer) have investigated this law and found no reason for it to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, because the laws in your country just suck that way. Can you justify representing a gay person in violation of this law as your ethical duty as a lawyer who believes that access to counsel for everyone is a fundamental ethic of lawyering, or would such an action be a textbook example of unethical legal practice?\n",
      "Just to be clear, this question is from the perspective of the theory and philosophy of law and legal practice rather than a question about any specific jurisdiction. If this has been formally addressed in any specific legal system or jurisdiction, an answer from the perspective is welcome. For example, \"The Supreme Court of Canada specifically ruled on this in 1973, here's what they said....\".\n",
      "Also to be clear, this question is about organized professional ethics (e.g. as ruled upon by bar committees and discussed in legal studies journals) rather than personal or religious moral codes.\n",

      "I hope to understand it in the general sense, but one particular example is that Taiwan just made adultery legal (update: or rather, \"not criminal but still has civil consequence\")... the judge saying that adultery being a crime would contradict with the \"a person's self will of having sex\" and \"current culture and ethics have changed\".  So on the one hand, legal precedent can say it can have some sentencing, but the \"current culture or ethics\" may make it legal.\n",

      "Original Question: What is the scope of Interpreter code of ethics coming into play in future congresional investigations?\n",
      "Full Question: It has been in the news lately that the President has had a number of private head ups with Putin. On the news someone suggested (Don't remember if it was a congress person or the newscaster), that the Interpreter should be subpoenaed to testify about what was said. \n",
      "One of the basic ethics for Interpreters is confidentiality of a conversation between two people. It does not seem that this confidentiality is *codified in the USA, the ethics being defined by associations.\n",
      "*Some courts have rules and guidelines and a few states have laws dealing with court room Interpreters.\n",
      "At any rate it does not seem that Interpreters have any kind of privilege like lawyers and other professions have to varying degree with clients. I would imagine that is because criminals don't use professional Interpreters very often and the issues surrounding any privilege for an Interpreter have never come up with much if any frequency. \n",
      "Can Congress compel the interpreter to testify, or can The President stop such testimony? \n",
      "Added: How about we take it out of the presidential realm, might actually be a bad example I used. Maybe say it was a translated conversation between diplomats or cabinet officers, and for whatever reason (not necessarily malicious), the person just doesn't want to answer any questions about the conversation or they became incapacitated, got pissed and quit the job, or died. So the interpreter is called as a witness. Can the interpreter be compelled to testify under subpoena from Congress? How about not under subpoena but something like the Ambassador has died what did they talk about when they last met?\n",

      "Original Question: Does a GP sending patient info to a hospital without asking for consent violate medical ethics?\n",
      "Full Question: So, let’s say that you went to a General Practitioner (GP) about some pain, got some tests done, and they told you that you were fine; all the tests came back normal.\n",
      "Then, some time later, they look back over the tests, and notice a condition that they had missed on their first look over them, and promptly sent the patient’s information to a local hospital so that they could book a surgery to correct the condition. This is done without consulting or informing the patient; the first time that they hear about it is when the hospital sends them a letter asking them to book an appointment for their surgery. If they had asked, the patient would have consented, but the patient wasn’t asked. This condition isn’t an immediately life-threatening one; the official categorisation that the hospital gave to it was “Semi-Urgent” which states that the surgery is to be performed within 90 days of the appointment being booked.\n",
      "Does this violate formal codes of medical ethics, or any professional or legal regulations regarding patient privacy? What would the consequences be for the GP if the patient were to make a complaint to a regulatory authority? This occurred in Australia.\n",

However, there is no formal diagnosis of a disability, and the family member will not permit a diagnosis to be made.  For the legal process to even get to a ruling on the merits of the capacity claims will substantially diminish the value in the trust, exhausting it to the point where it can't support the family member.\n",

      "Full Question: Philosophy newbie here!\n",
      "I was reading up on the very basics on ethics and the division to normative and descriptive struck me as odd.\n",
      "From biological viewpoint the fundamental nature of this field seems much like upside-down mathematics: derivation from axioms vs discovery of axioms (=core values?) – \"if you ask why long enough you arrive at 'just because'\". Or alternatively, setting up (or describing) fundamental goals or valuation systems based on what satisfies the part of our brain that evolved to help us team up and survive as hunter-gatherers. Then building on top of that – describing derived goals or valuation systems on how to reach the axiomatic goals efficiently.\n",
      "Is the nature of normative ethics the author prescribing their personal axioms (=descriptive ethics with n=1)? Does the field as a whole have a shared set of axioms and normative ethics argues over how to reach those efficiently? If so, is it to draw first level derivates from the descriptive side from sort of a popular vote and use those as a goal (with the sole axiom being to draw from descriptivism)? If so, to what extent are the conclusions universal versus a reflection of the author's time and society?\n",
      "PS. This might be a stupid question in the sense that it's probably well covered in the literature, but was unable to find an answer with reasonable effort. Any recommended reading or general insights?\n",

Class stratification was justified on the basis of “natural” inequalities among individuals, for the control of property was said to be a correlate of superior and inherent moral attributes such as industriousness, temperance, and frugality. Attempts to reform society through state intervention or other means would, therefore, interfere with natural processes; unrestricted competition and defense of the status quo were in accord with biological selection. The poor were the “unfit” and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence, wealth was a sign of success. At the societal level, social Darwinism was used as a philosophical rationalization for imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies, sustaining belief in Anglo-Saxon or Aryan cultural and biological superiority.\n",

      "Full Question: US Supreme Court justices are procedurally nominated by one politician (US president) and then interviewed, vetted and ultimately approved or rejected by about one hundred other politicians (US Senate and potentially US Vice President). This is a political process and it is impossible today to read informed discussions of the supreme court justices (former, current, and pending) without labels like \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" appearing regularly.\n",

In a phone call to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the hours after Ginsburg's death was announced, Lagoa was one of a few names Trump floated as his potential pick, according to people familiar with the call.

      "Original Question: Is US Senator Chris Murphy&#39;s bill to &quot;subject Supreme Court Justices to... ethical code&quot; just saber rattling? (Amy Klobuchar: &quot;Get your act together&quot;)\n",
      "Full Question: In the 2022-03-27 ABC News video Ginni Thomas texts to Meadows is a 'textbook' case for recusal: Sen. Klobuchar | ABC News after 03:24 ABC's Jonathan Karl quotes two text messages from Ginni Thomas, wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and ends without a specific question, leaving Senator Amy Klobuchar an opportunity to issue what seems to be a statement of position on the issue of the (at least apparent) lack of any current ethics guidelines1 for the justices of the US Supreme Court (my transcription with assistance from closed captions):\n",
      "\n",
      "Karl: ...I mean, my goodness!\n",
      "Klobuchar: Johnathan the facts are clear here. This is unbelievable. You have the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice advocating for an insurrection - advocating for overturning a legal election to a sitting president's chief of staff. And she also knows this election - these cases are going to come before her husband.\n",
      "This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him from these decisions. And I don't  think - all I hear is silence from the supreme court right now. And that better change in the coming week, because every other federal judge in the country except Supreme Court justices would have a guidance from ethics rules that says you've gotta recuse himself.\n",
      "Thomas himself recused himself in 1995 from a case involving a school because his son was going to that school. Justice Breyer recused himself when his wife was on the board of an entity and that case came before the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Karl: And if he doesn't? If he doesn't recuse himself?\n",
      "Klobuchar: Justice Rob... I mean the entire integrity of the Court is on the line here, and they had better speak out on this because you can not have a justice hearing cases related to this election... and in fact the ethics rules that apply to all the other federal judges say that if it involves a family member - appearance of impartiality - they have to recuse themselves.\n",
      "So not only should he recuse himself, but this supreme court badly needs ethics rules. Chris Murphy's leading a bill (that) I've long been on (and) supportive of that says basically \"Get your act together, get ethics rules in place.\"  And I would hope justice Roberts, who I respect, will stand up and get those ethics rules in place. They've gotta do it, they should do it themselves.\n",

      "Original Question: Does US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts have recusal power over another Justice if they don&#39;t do it themself? (e.g. Clarence Thomas)\n",
      "Full Question: In the 2022-03-27 ABC News video Ginni Thomas texts to Meadows is a 'textbook' case for recusal: Sen. Klobuchar | ABC News after 03:24 ABC's Jonathan Karl quotes two text messages from Ginni Thomas, wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and ends without a specific question, leaving Senator Amy Klobuchar an opportunity to issue what seems to be a statement of position on the issue of the (at least apparent) lack of any current ethics guidelines1 for the justices of the US Supreme Court (my transcription with assistance from closed captions):\n",
      "\n",
      "Karl: ...I mean, my goodness!\n",
      "Klobuchar: Johnathan the facts are clear here. This is unbelievable. You have the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice advocating for an insurrection - advocating for overturning a legal election to a sitting president's chief of staff. And she also knows this election - these cases are going to come before her husband.\n",
      "This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him from these decisions. And I don't  think - all I hear is silence from the supreme court right now. And that better change in the coming week, because every other federal judge in the country except Supreme Court justices would have a guidance from ethics rules that says you've gotta recuse himself.\n",
      "Thomas himself recused himself in 1995 from a case involving a school because his son was going to that school. Justice Breyer recused himself when his wife was on the board of an entity and that case came before the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Karl: And if he doesn't? If he doesn't recuse himself?\n",
      "Klobuchar: Justice Rob... I mean the entire integrity of the Court is on the line here, and they had better speak out on this because you can not have a justice hearing cases related to this election... and in fact the ethics rules that apply to all the other federal judges say that if it involves a family member - appearance of impartiality - they have to recuse themselves.\n",
      "So not only should he recuse himself, but this supreme court badly needs ethics rules. Chris Murphy's leading a bill (that) I've long been on (and) supportive of that says basically \"Get your act together, get ethics rules in place.\"  And I would hope justice Roberts, who I respect, will stand up and get those ethics rules in place. They've gotta do it, they should do it themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see two related but separate elements in Klobuchar's position:\n",
      "\n",
      "(the focus of this question)Thomas must recuse or perhaps be recused2 in (at least 2020 presidential) election cases.\n",
      "The Supreme Court had better get its \"act together, get ethics rules in place\" or else Congress will make them do it (or do it for them?)3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Does US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts have the power to recuse Justice Clarence Thomas from specific cases related the 2020 presidential election and its aftermath due to his wife Ginny Thomas's perceived involvement if Thomas doesn't recuse himself?\n",
      "What piqued my interest is Klobuchar's response to Karl's question \"And if he doesn't? If he doesn't recuse himself?\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Justice Rob... I mean the entire integrity of the Court is on the line here, and they had better speak out on this\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And I would hope justice Roberts, who I respect, will stand up and get those ethics rules in place.\"\n",

      "While Klobuchar is primarily expecting or at least hoping for Roberts to take some action on implementing ethics rules quickly, that she began her response to \"And if he doesn't\" with \"Justice Rob...\" and then cut her self off and changed tack suggests to me at least that she may have been dangling the idea that Roberts could recuse Thomas.\n",

      "Original Question: What are general benefits and disadvantages for political leaders to be honest with their people?\n",
      "Full Question: This is quite a broad question since obviously there are many different political systems and ways of governing around the world. But I would like to boil it down to some standard concepts of leadership, ethics, and responsibility to govern a nation.\n",
      "Throughout history (recent and long past) there are many recorded instances where a political leader (or their direct team) have been blatantly dishonest about their activities to the general public/their people eg. Watergate. In other instances decisions have been made which have direct affect on people's lives but have not allowed individuals to make their own decisions regarding these eg. Snowden. In these instances I am curious as to how leadership, ethics and governance ideally should be considered as a part of the pros and cons of the decision i.e. are they given equal weight or is the final outcome more important?\n",
      "As an example, looking at the Snowden case; the apparent benefit of the \"dishonesty\" was that it made a nation more safe, while the general disadvantage was less privacy. One was decided to be more important than the other at that point in time.\n",
      "Therefore in a general sense what are the benefits and disadvantages for political leaders to be honest with the people they are leading/governing?\n",

      "Original Question: Special parliament that controls and oversees the Justice and Law enforcement systems\n",
      "Full Question: In countries like the USA many people are frustrated with the control of the legislative majority or head of state over Justice appointments and the Law enforcement agencies (accusing the law enforcement of bias etc.), while in countries like Israel many people are frustrated with the inability of the nation to influence the ethics, morals and common sense according to which the judges are judging, as well as concern/accusations that the law enforcement agencies are becoming corrupt and biased due to the lack of civil oversight.\n",
      "The argument not to allow judges to be elected by heads of state or regular parliaments, is basically that it may become too politicized and contaminated with other personal political goals, selfish interests and deals between parties. (Like people who fear that some future American president may become some sort of Putinistic leader, who will get his police, his AG and his judges to persecute his opponents (or like the people who believe that this is the situation today)).\n",
      "Would the best solution be to establish a separate parliament, of delegates elected directly by the people (maybe about 30 seats), which is not related to the executive or legislative branches of government, which would elect/approve new judges, approve constitutional laws and also oversee the police, investigation and prosecution agencies?\n",
      "According to my understanding, this would ensure that the ethics and values of the sitting justices would reflect the value systems of all groups in the nation, as well as law enforcement integrity. While not being impacted by short-sighted coalition-opposition (pro/anti government) politics.\n",
      "An argument in favor of this proposal, may be, that usually when people are appointed to positions that require them to be apolitical, like judges, diplomats and ceremonial heads of state, they adjust (or try to adjust) to that standard. Executive heads of state and members of legislative parliaments are not asked to be apolitical.\n",
      "Can you see any possible problems with such a system?\n",
      "Note: In this question, when I write Politics, I'm refering to personal politics, i.e. pro/anti a certain politician. Moral/ethical controversies are totaly legitimate issues when considering/debating the appointment of judges etc.\n",

      "In the United States I'm used to having only 2, well established, political parties. Republicans always vote together. Democrats always vote together. It's an outlier when a handful of members \"cross the aisle\" to vote against their party.

      "I am currently taking an ethics course, and have been a proponent for capitalism for some time due to my economic opinions. However, this class brought up the valid point that capitalism tends to leave some behind, and did so in a way that I found convincing through the metric of the 'Happiness Report.' \n",
      "It would seem that Socialism is more conducive to a happy society, as it takes accountability for everyone's well-being.\n",
      "Capitalism, conversely, less conducive to happiness as it takes accountability for progression, output, and personal achievement - all of which seem content with leaving others behind. \n",
      "I enjoy the values that capitalism (or, America and American Capitalism) bring about in society. But how does it effectively tackle happiness, especially when compared to Socialism? \n",

      "Original Question: What has been the historical trend of U.S. congresspeople voting as blocks?\n",
      "Full Question: It feels as though every time I've looked at voting records from the U.S. congress, I notice that virtually everyone votes with their party; that is, for any given bill, every Republican votes the same as every other Republican, and every Democrat likewise votes the same as every other Democrat. The number of exceptions tends to be very low - typically less than ten from either party, which is a tiny number of the House of Representatives' several-hundred members. Further, it seems the more consequential the vote, the more likely for members of congress to vote with their party, rather than against.\n",
      "Have there been any studies of the historical strength of this trend? I.e., how the number of \"rogue\" votes in either house has changed over the years? Is this tendency of parties to vote en bloc a (relatively) recent phenomenon, or has it been the trend for as long as the U.S.A. has had political parties?\n",
      "PLEASE NOTE: I am not asking about the reasons, mechanisms, ethics, or anything else related to the practice of \"voting the party line\" in the U.S. I am only interested in the history of the practice with this question. The moral implications of it are an entirely different discussion for some other time.\n",

      "Full Question: The Matrix, a famous 1999 Wachowski movie set in a near dystopian cyperpunk future, deals with a \"neuro-interactive simulation\" that was created by out-of-control machines and pulled over the \"desert of the real\" in order to enslave humanity. The Matrix (the software) belongs to the realm of the mind, whereas the machines (the hardware) belong to physical reality, while humans (the users) live and die in both worlds.\n",
      "Agent Smith is a \"rogue\" neural program within the Matrix, a full-blown virus of the mind that infiltrates, replicates, spreads, and consumes - modifying human behavior into treason and murder.\n",
      "In a classic scene, Smith - while torturing Morpheus, a human rebel - provokes the audience with a stark observation on human behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed, and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we...are the cure.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Having just recently watched this masterpiece during two long weeks of self-isolation, I was left with a lasting impression by both its philosophical implications and political actuality/relevance. Fact-checking on Smith's epidemiological analysis, I found several examples in modern history that seem to check virtually all the 'epidemiological' boxes regarding virulence, human-to-human transmission, global spread, resources consumption, and destructiveness:\n",

      "Coming from a physics background I lack the knowledge and proper training in political science, but AFAIK there are theories that champion a similarly \"mechanical\", \"inevitably Darwinist\" view on politics, human nature, and history (\"realism\"?) as advocated by Agent Smith's character.\n",
      "Let's, for a moment, make the assumption that realism holds and that ethics does not exist, i.e. let's consider the software + hardware and neglect the user.\n",
      "=> Are there works in political science that actually use epidemiological concepts, models, and methods to analyze and possibly predict politics?\n",
      "There are fictional works that describe powerful predictive frameworks such as \"psychohistory\" in Asimov's Foundation trilogy - but how much is this in the realm of current scientific practice?\n",
      "*I hope it's clear that the idea is not to equate humans (users) with viruses (software), but to identify those cultural elements that drive and sustain \"virulent\" politics. Smith's analogy, of course, is fundamentally flawed - but it touches on important moral problems, e.g. ethics in stem cell research:\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite apart from the fact that a [genetic] program cannot be equated with its result, this statement [that a fertilized egg cell is already in the full sense a human being] is also incorrect for other important reasons. [...] Without the mother's organism, the fertilized egg cell can only develop into a vesicle made up of a little more than a hundred human cells; the factors in its own cytoplasm are sufficient for this, but not further.\n",

      "Original Question: Did Devin Nunes ever reveal evidence of unmasking abuse?\n",
      "Full Question: When the name of a US citizen is incidentally collected by the US Intelligence Community as part of intelligence activities, the name in masked in intelligence reports to protect the person’s identity.  And then later on, if there is a vital need for a US government official to know who the person is, the official can request that the name can be unmasked, but only if they can cite a valid reason to do so.\n",
      "Now on March 22, 2017, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes, then-Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, gave a press conference where he said that he presented President Trump with evidence that the Obama Administration had improperly unmasked the names of Trump Transition team officials.  Nunes’ actions were heavily criticized, both because he did not share this information with Democrats on the committee, and because the information he presented to President Trump appeared to originate from the White House itself.  This led to Nunes having to recuse himself from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation while he and his actions became the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation.\n",
      "My question is, did Congressman Nunes ever publicly reveal any evidence of unmasking abuse by the Obama Administration related to Trump Transition team officials?  In this July 27, 2017 letter to DNI Dan Coats, Nunes stated that his investigation into unmasking abuse was still ongoing, and I seem to recall another statement from him to that effect some time in 2018.\n",
      "But has Nunes ever addressed what became of this unmasking abuse investigation?  Note that this is distinct from alleged “FISA abuse”, which is another issue that Nunes is famous for raising.\n",

      "Original Question: Is it fair to punish the student for not knowing what&#39;s in the course?\n",
      "Full Question: A number of questions (e. g., this one or that one) discuss the situations where the student is punished after invoking, in the exam context, knowledge that's outside the scope of the course. This leads to a more general question: \n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose the student knows and understands perfectly all the material taught in the course, and perhaps some more. Is it fair to lower their grade for not knowing which material has been taught and how it was presented?\n",
      "\n",
      "From the answers to the above questions, it seems that many feel that there's no problem with lowering the grade. I can think of two arguments in favour of that view:\n",
      "\n",
      "in order to test knowledge, the exam questions have to include implicit context, notation, etc., that require familiarity with a particular course. More details on this type of reasoning can be found in this answer.\n",
      "anyway, the grades are often not determined solely by what students know in the end; e. g., attending lectures, participating in the class discussions, etc., may be part of the grade. And if you have done so, surely you know what's been in the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain why the above arguments do not satisfy me. The first one concedes that it may be unfair, and then essentially admits a failure on the part of the professor to design a fair exam. But then, shouldn't one rather strive to make the questions as self-contained and unambiguous as possible? For the second one, we may ask, again, why it is fair to take anything but the end knowledge into account for the grade, and the answer will likely be that some version of \"we use attendance etc. as a proxy for final knowledge\" which, once again, brushes off the question as to how fair is this.\n",

      "Original Question: Is it fair to desk-reject a manuscript because it breaks relativity?\n",
      "Full Question: Every so often a journal I edit receives papers with some kind of claim that, if true, would break mainstream physics. For example, a paper could claim that waves in dark matter can travel at v ~ 1014 m/s.\n",
      "Because relativity has met every experimental test we've thrown at it, and because relativity has a hard limit on velocities at the speed of light (3×108 m/s), any paper making this kind of claim is immediately suspect. One doesn't need to know what else is in the paper to be pretty confident it is wrong.\n",
      "However, it is also known that relativity is an incomplete theory because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. It's conceivable that whatever theory eventually supplants these two theories could allow velocities greater than the speed of light.\n",
      "Question: Is it fair to desk-reject the above paper based solely on this one sentence? Like, there's a 99.99% chance (maybe even higher) that the paper is wrong, but there's still a nonzero chance it could be correct. If it is unfair, what else do I need before it becomes fair to desk-reject?\n",

      "Original Question: Is it fair to have follow-up interviews after a test following suspicions of cheating?\n",
      "Full Question: We recently held online midterm exams at my institution, where I am a manager. (We were forced online just before the exams.) The exams included a range of subjects, and were typically less than 2 hours.\n",
      "There are indications of cheating (e.g. exam scores much higher than offline performance, answers that seem to be copied from each other, etc.). So I am planning to send the following message to the students:\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next few days, some students will be informed by subject teachers that there is indication of academic dishonesty in their midterm exam. The student will have the option of responding to the teacher's message to schedule a confidential teacher-student video interview of approximately 15 minutes, in which the teacher will determine whether the student's exam score is reliable. If the student schedules and passes the interview, then their midterm exam score will be accepted. Otherwise, their midterm exam score will not be counted in their semester grade, and their final exam grade will count as both their midterm exam and final exam grade. If the student would like to know details about the indication of academic dishonesty, these can be discussed after the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the video interview, the students will be given oral questions about the topics covered on the midterm exam, to assess whether their exam score is reliable.\n",
      "Question: Is this fair?\n",
      "As far as school policy: Before the midterm exams, the students were given a set of rules and consequences about the midterm exams: camera and microphone activated, hands visible, etc. But these rules cannot completely prevent cheating. (A student's hand could be briefly off-camera, and it would be unreasonably harsh to give them an automatic zero for that.)\n",
      "My motivation for doing this, is to protect (as much as possible) the honest students from being disadvantaged by their honesty.\n",
      "UPDATE\n",
      "I decided not to do the follow-up interviews, because they are not in the school policies. (If they were in the school policies, then they would have been fair, to the extent that standard anti-cheating policies are fair.)\n",

      "\n",
      "In machine learning, a given algorithm is said to be fair, or to have\n",
      "  fairness if its results are independent of some variables we consider\n",
      "  to be sensitive and not related to it (f.e.: gender, ethnicity,\n",
      "  sexual orientation, etc.).\n",

      "  characteristics, such as, gender, race, religion, physical ability,\n",
      "  and sexual orientation\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other resources, like Google in the ML Fairness limit the fairness to these aforementioned categories and no other categories are considered. \n",
      "But fairness is a lot broader context than simply these few categories mentioned here, you could easily add another few like IQ, height, beauty anything that could have a real impact on your credit score, school application or job application. Some of these categories may not be popular in existing datasets nowadays but given the exponential growth of data, they will be soon, to the extent, that we will have an abundance of data about every individual with all their physical and mental categories mapped into the datasets.\n",
      "Then the question would be how to define fairness given all these categories presented in the datasets. And will it even be possible to define fairness if all physical and mental dimensions are considered as it seems that when we do so, all our weights in, say, the neural nets should be exactly the same, i.e., giving no discriminator in any way or form towards or against any physical or mental category of a human being? That means that a machine learning system that is fair across all possible dimensions will have no way of distinguishing one human being from another which would render these machine learning models useless. \n",
      "To wrap it up, while it does make perfect sense to withdraw bias towards any individual given the categories like gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc., the set is not closed and with the increasing number of categories being added to this set, we will inevitably arrive at a point where no discrimination (in a statistical sense) would be possible. \n",
      "And that's why my question, are fair machine learning models possible?\n",
      "Or perhaps, the only possible fair machine learning models are those that arbitrarily include some categories but ignore other categories which, of course, if far from being fair.\n",

The cleaner's actions are Suck, Left, and Right and it can't go out of the rectangle and the squares are either empty or dirty. I know this is an amateur question but how does randomization (for instance flipping a fair coin) avoid entering the infinite loop? Aren't we entering such a loop If the result of the toss is heads in odd tosses and tails in even tosses?\n",

Such an agent has just two possible percepts: [Dirty] and [Clean]. It can Suck in response to [Dirty]; what should it do in response to [Clean]? Moving Left fails (forever) if it happens to start in square\n",
      "A, and moving Right fails (forever) if it happens to start in square B. Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. Escape from infinite loops is possible if the agent can randomize its actions. For example, if the vacuum agent perceives [Clean], it might flip a coin to choose between Right and Left. It is easy to show that the agent will reach the other square in an average of two steps. Then, if that square is dirty, the agent will clean it and the task will be complete. Hence, a randomized simple reflex agent might outperform a deterministic simple reflex agent.\n",

I wonder how you keep up with the current state of the art and latest developments? The field is progressing very fast, models that were considered SOTA not even a decade ago are now (almost) outdated (Attention Is All You Need). A lot of this progress is driven by big tech companies (source), e.g. 12% of all papers accepted at NeurIPS 2019 have at least one author from Google and DeepMind (source).\n",
      "My strategy is to read blogs and articles to maintain a general overview and not to miss any important breakthroughs. To be up to date in subfields of my own interest, I read specific papers once in a while. What are your personal strategies? Continuous education is a big keyword here. It's not about understanding every detail and being able to reproduce results, but rather maintaining a bird's eye view, having an idea about the direction of research and knowing whats already possible.\n",
      "To name a few of my preferred sources there are the research blogs of the big players: OpenAI, DeepMind, Google AI, FAIR. Further there are very good personal blogs with a more educational character, like the well known one of Christopher Olah, the recently started one of Yoshua Bengio and the one from Jay Alammar. Unfortunately finding personal blogs is hard, it often depends on luck and referrals, also the update frequency is generally lower since these people have (understandably) other important things to do in life as well.\n",

My first idea was to downsample the test to have the same number of participants with the disease than healthy. But our discussion takes place because the testing cannot be touched. But this is clear in diagnosis and prediction but not for fairness. Some papers srratify by groups. If I use the full cohort most of the cases are healthy women (negative and sensitive group) in a ratio e.g., of 7.000 vs 100 so the fairness is most showing the bias for the healthy women than what i am more interested women with disease and this is not what i want. I wonder if someone thought about this issue. Fairness is a new issue and i do not see it clearly to treat it as prediction or classification.

It seems that this is doing average pooling over the word tokens to get a sentence vector, but we never suggested that this will generate meaningful sentence representations. And even if they are decent representations when fed into a DNN trained for a downstream task, it doesn't mean that they will be meaningful in terms of cosine distance.

I know this is a widely done procedure in datascience but I wanted to do my own research on it. Currently the biggest problem is training time, and to solve that I had an idea. What if I I trained an ANN to predict the degree of the polynomial that best fits the model then use standard polynomial regression to curve fit. This would make the training only happen once so I could train for as long as I wanted, and thus it would increase speed by a lot. What are your thought in this? Has anyone done this before?

I see a number of services in the marketplace which summarize business books or self-help books, but my research hasn't been able to uncover how they are able to proceed without triggering legal action on the part of publishers.

According to copyright, you need permission to use intellectual property but fair use says you don't need permission as long as you use the work under specific circumstances. Hypothetically, if a copyright terms explicitly stated it cannot be used by others and at the same time someone used this specific copyrighted content without permission in a context that matches the criteria of fair use, would the doctrine of fair use supersede the copyright?\n",

      "Original Question: How to determine a fair sentence?\n",
      "Full Question: I am reading a book called Noise, I am still at the beginning, but already I have a question. The book in the first chapter tells the story of how the US Sentencing Commission tried to set some guidelines for the criminal sentences. By their own admission they did not have a method to determine a fair sentence and their solution was to take an average of past sentences. I thought that such solution was too simplistic and I wondered whether there could be a better way.\n",
      "One solution could be to study the outcome of past convictions. Someone could take some past cases where the convict has served the entire sentence at least x years ago, group these cases by type of crime, circumstances and the length of the sentence (maybe discretised) count the number of convictions in each group and calculate the percentage of repeated offenders. I guess that, barring some noise, it could be possible to fit a curve to these data that would see the number of repeated offenders inversely proportional to the length of the sentence. In many case a change in the slope of the curve could indicate point that would optimise the trade off between the length of the sentence and the number of repeated offenders.\n",
      "Did anybody ever make a similar study to determine what could be a fair sentence? I am not a law expert and I am sure that there could be other methods that are a lot more sophisticated, but this seems a step ahead compared to the solution adopted by the Sentencing Commission. Am I right or is there a flaw in this idea?\n",

      "Submitting DMCA counter-notices to Twitter\n",
      "\n",
      "In these counter notices, I've given all the required statements, as well as extra detail into their Fair Use Policy, explaining that my program is compliant with all the points detailed at that link.\n",

      "\n",
      "If we don’t receive a notice from the complainant within 10 business days, we’ll cease withholding the material. The complainant’s notice must confirm that they’ve sought a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to content on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every case where I've received this email, I have never received a further notice from the complainant, but Twitter never ceased withholding the material after 10 business days either. I receive no further communications from both Twitter and the complainant.\n",

      "Doesn't that program enable users to download copyrighted material from YouTube and other sites? Just because a tool could potentially be used to violate the DMCA, does that mean it can get taken down? Not in youtube-dl's case, and I don't see a difference with mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "How could anything helping users to add music not be used to facilitate adding without consent?\n",

      "\n",
      "the business of supplying the equipment that makes such copying feasible should not be stifled simply because the equipment is used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions of respondents' works....\n",
      "\n",
      "EditVideoBot is an automated program that automatically edits videos based on commands provided by other Twitter users that mention the account - I am providing the service, other people operate and produce the material with it. I don't see why I need to take the fall.\n",

      "Full Question: Background\n",
      "Fair use hinges on four factors, which are then weighed by judges:\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose and Character of the Use\n",
      "Nature of the Copyrighted Work\n",
      "Amount of Copyrighted Work Used\n",
      "Effect of the Use on Potential Market for the Work\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair use is also defined generally/vaguely, so it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, where a judge and jury weigh these 4 factors to come to a determination on whether a use is considered a fair use.\n",
      "For (1), Nolo says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since copyright law favors encouraging scholarship, research, education, and commentary, a judge is more likely to make a determination of fair use if the defendant's use is noncommercial, educational, scientific, or historical. However, an educational or scientific use that is for commercial purposes may not be excused by the fair use doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "For (3), the amount of work in my case would be a full high resolution image.\n",
      "For (2), a lot of the examples I have found are about fiction vs. non-fiction (\"informational\") works, which mostly applies to artwork and text, but not photography of things you would find in an encyclopedia (pictures of places, things, and people, for example).\n",
      "For (4), the effect on the market of the work could be positive (if it is a generally good encyclopedia article) or negative.\n",
      "All of these 4 factors should be weighed to determine if it is considered fair use to use the images.\n",
      "Question\n",
      "What are the key court cases and or factors to consider if you are making an online Encyclopedia or database of facts so to speak (like Wikipedia), where you have topics, and each topic might have several images to go along with custom articles describing or teaching about or analyzing the topic? The images can be CC of various kinds, or perhaps it is okay to use any image, even if it doesn't have a permissive license. Specifically I am looking for a list of the key examples regarding the combination of education (scientific, documentary, library, etc.) and images. Or if there aren't any related examples, if this situation could generically be assumed to be fair use.\n",
      "The determining factors are, in my head, (a) are you trying to do a good thing, and (b) do you add anything to the equation? In terms of an Encyclopedia using arbitrary images published by various authors to the web, writing about the topic in which the image is used seems like it would count as fair use.\n",
      "For example, say you were writing about the Origin of Tokyo, and used a modern high-res creative photograph of Tokyo taken by someone, such as this:\n",
      "\n",
      "And you wrote about the Origin of Tokyo in your own words. Is that something which might be considered \"fair use\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose is for education and to push society forward, and the photograph is transformed in the sense that the image is now in the context of an educational article, with \"commentary\" or \"analysis\" not necessarily about the image itself, but the image weaves into the fabric of the article to impress new knowledge on the consumer in a unique way.\n",
      "The copyrighted work is not fiction (although it is a creative angle of a non-fiction thing).\n",
      "The whole original work is used (i.e. the \"original\" high-res photograph available on the web).\n",
      "If anything, traffic will increase or stay the same to the original image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also note, this is modeled after Wikipedia in the sense that it is a non-profit, doing this to spread free knowledge, but might rely on donations. If the donations count against it, in what way could you lower the risk so you can pretty much guarantee a fair use determination.\n",

      "Original Question: &quot;Reality is a social construct&quot; -- fair characterization or not?\n",
      "Full Question: This is something else I've wondered about. There seem to be these fierce online debates and movements that center around various questions of the validity of so called \"social justice\" issues which are full of lots of emotive stuff from both sides pro and con (e.g. terms like \"man/white/cis/whatever 'splaining'\" and \"SJWs\" are thrown against the opposing 'sides' respectively from pro and con sides against con and pro sides). One of the central pieces of this argumentation seems to hinge around this notion of this alleged philosophical idea that \"reality is a social construct\" against \"reality is objective\". But the thing is, reading it, I wonder if the various partisans involved really do or do not understand exactly what they are bandying about in these heated arguments.\n",
      "In particular, the \"reality is a social construct\" is attributed variously to the \"left\", \"academic left\", \"Cultural Marxism\" but also \"postmodernism\". The first two terms seem like political charges, the third seems like a weird slur, but the fourth is a legitimate philosophical reference. Also perhaps \"social theory\" or \"critical theory\" is indicted with as being \"guilty\" of this \"bad\" philosophical \"notion\".\n",
      "But the question is, is that a truly fair characterization, and if so, what exactly does it mean? Because to me, if you take it absolutely literally, it cannot be true, for a very simple reason: I cannot sign an agreement with someone that will magically make gold appear by miracle in my room by both of us agreeing that that gold now exists in the room. If reality behaved this way, it would seem a lot of politicking and wars would be easily resolved: we could just \"legislate\" or \"social construct\" literally every resource we wanted into existence. Yet I would find it hard to imagine this argument would have escaped notice of everyone who has argued what is construed as \"reality is a social construct\". So thus I'd like to know, what does that phrase actually mean in regard to what it's actually referring to by any serious thinker and not merely some random joe-blow with an opinion on the internet and an ax to grind (of either partisan persuasion), is it even a fair characterization at all, and if so, how is the above argument answered and dismissed?\n",

      "Post URL: https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/76690/maximizing-expected-value-triple-or-nothing-on-a-fair-bet\n",
      "Original Question: Maximizing expected value - &quot;triple or nothing&quot; on a fair bet\n",
      "Full Question: The \"triple-or-nothing paradox\" is that a game where I expect to increase my money (on average) at each stage ends up bankrupting me with probability 1 if I play long enough. However, the paradox seems to have an easy resolution, in the sense that a rational actor could decide that a 50% risk of losing your entire stake on each round is simply too high.\n",
      "A slight modification removes the \"easy way out\" for this rational actor: I stake an initial wager W to play this game. At each coin flip, I either lose 75% of my current stake, or gain 125% of my current stake, with 50-50 probability. Any individual round of this game is quite attractive to a bettor, for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "at every wager, the amount the bettor stands to win is bigger than the amount they stand to lose\n",
      "\n",
      "the bettor never loses their entire stake (if we consider continuous quantities of money) and thus can always make a comeback\n",
      "\n",
      "the bettor's expected value of their wager is 1/2 (125% - 75%) = 25% gain\n",
      "\n",
      "expected value after n rounds is (1.25)^n of initial stake -- the bettor's expectation increases exponentially\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At each round, the bettor has to choose between playing again and cashing out. The arguments above seem to favor playing again for any individual round. Yet over time, the bettor's wealth approaches 0 with probability 1: because it multiplies by 2.25 on wins, but divides by 4 on losses, more than 1 win is required to balance out a loss. Since the flips are fair, this means the bettor's wealth is multiplied on average by (2.25)/4 = 9/16 = 56.25% for every 2 rounds, which translates to a 3/4 = 75% multiplier per round on average. In other words, the bettor's actual wealth (as opposed to their expected wealth) multiplies by about 0.75 on each round, hence approaches 0 for large numbers of rounds.\n",
      "The paradox is then that during the game, the bettor always has a reason to play the next round in terms of expectation. It is always irrational for them to stop playing after any particular round. Thus, a rational actor will decide to continue playing forever, whereupon their initial stake dwindles to zero with probability 1. How is it that making the most rational decision at each stage (whether one is currently winning or losing) leads to going broke?\n",
      "Edit: Some commenters have attempted to resolve the paradox by appealing to an individual’s utility differing from the strict monetary payoffs. However, this attempted resolution utterly fails: if we know an individual’s utilities, we can always set up a version of this paradox that applies to them specifically. They “stake” something worth a certain amount of utility to them, and at each stage of the game, either lose 75% of the utility value of their current stake, or gain 125% of the utility value of their current stake. Once the game has been adjusted to their utility preferences, they face the same paradox as before. The presentation in terms of monetary value is for expositional purposes only and in no way fundamental to the paradox itself.\n",

      "Full Question: In liberal democracies, basically, people don't need to fear getting killed at any moment, being put arbitrary in prison, or dying in misery. They, basically, can follow their personal path as they wish.\n",
      "Being fair (being committed to truth and justice) and seeking happiness for themselves and others is amply sufficient to having a good life and making a difference. See the research by Anderson and Keltner.\n",
      "So they don't need to desperately achieve status as a means to get safety and resources.\n",
      "But it seems people are still so much seeking status, as if it were a question of life and death, like in the jungle for instance, in a machiavellian manner (using charisma, inflating their achievements, buying goods they can't afford to appear more successful, perpetuating power struggles by gossiping, etc. See social media).\n",

      "Full Question: I am referring, of course, to the existential crisis of global warming. Regardless of whether or not we've by now passed the tipping point, obviously there was a time when 'we had time to act' (say, on November 7, 2000). So, ethically speaking, am I morally justified in despising humanity as a whole? Epistemologically, after all, it is said that \"morals are about (human) survival and reproduction and have nothing to do with moral truth.\" Meaning we've failed the critical test? And that, if so, would seem to warrant as more than just opinion my both 'misanthropic' and generalized loathing of all of humanity. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/\n",

      "Original Question: Is getting 100 Heads in a row from a fair coin a miracle or not?\n",
      "Full Question: Suppose a man continues to toss a coin until he gets 100 heads in a row. Suppose the outcomes of all tosses from the 9999901th toss to the 10 millionth toss are all heads and 100 heads in a row didn't happen before this.\n",
      "Now, if someone went back in time or God told the man at the time he was going to start tossing the coin, that it would take him 10 million tosses to get 100 heads in a row, then it would not seem like a miracle to him because the probability of getting 100 heads in a row in a million tosses is already very close to 1. So, 100 consecutive heads was already bound to happen in 10 million tosses anyway.\n",
      "But from the point of view of the man just before the 99999001th toss, he knows that the previous 9999000 tosses don't matter at all. The probability of getting 100 heads in a row at that moment is the same old (1/2)^100 (so it is almost an impossible event). The fact that he has been tossing the coin for a long time is not going affect his current chances of getting 100 consecutive heads. So, it is indeed a miracle that he got 100 heads in a row after that moment.\n",

      "Original Question: Are the differences between capitalism&#39;s and socialism&#39;s analysis of resource distribution fairness fundamental?\n",
      "Full Question: I have always understood a (broadly speaking) capitalist, free market approach to economics to rest on the notion that a resource distribution is fair in light of how closely it correlates the resources an individual or firm receives to the value they contribute to the market.  This value might be apparent and concrete, such as a good, service, loan, land utilization, labor, etc., or abstract, such as human attention, a vivid vision of a firm's future operations and role in the economy, liquidity, etc.\n",
      "On the flip side, I have understood a (broadly speaking) socialist approach to economics to rest on the notion that a resource distribution is fair in light of how closely it correlates the resources an individual or firm receives to his/her/its need for such resources.  For example, August Becker described \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" as \"the basic principle of communism.\"\n",
      "However, in order to ground normative claims related to the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction, perhaps most notably the claim that the hierarchies they form and occupy in a capitalist economy are fundamentally unjust, socialists seem to make frequent use of the former notion of fairness, perhaps merely failing to recognize some of the categories listed above as legitimate value (claiming that CEOs, landlords, securities traders, etc., \"contribute nothing to society\"), but generally recognizing at least labor, goods, and services as legitimate things to correlate to the acquisition of economic resources.  Whether or not you think this is a narrow minded analysis of what contributes to society, at the least it is an attempt to correlate resource distribution with contribution to society, as opposed to with need.  Thus I am confused as to what notion of fairness a socialist economic theory actually rests upon.\n",
      "Obviously, pretty much everyone agrees that a fair resource distribution is not automatically a good resource distribution.  No one getting any resources is presumably fair, but not very good.  The goodness of a resource distribution is thus a multivariable function of its fairness and some other consideration(s).\n",
      "Does the socialist fundamentally disagree with the capitalist about what constitutes a fair resource distribution, or is the foundational notion of fairness agreed upon, with the socialist merely giving less weight than the capitalist to fairness relative to the other considerations that factor into crafting a viable resource distribution model?\n",

      "Full Question: In preparation for an upcoming vote the phrase \"Whipping\" and \"Whip count\" is frequently heard. In fact there are legislators whose title it is to be \"the Whip\".\n",
      "Whipping conjures up an image of coercion (the master will stop beating the horse, if the horse does exactly the master's will or the master promises something, say a carrot, if the horse behaves the way the master wants). \n",
      "Could legislators be coerced, (by denying access to congressional campaign funds, or losing a coveted committee assignment, or rewarded by endorsement by senior party members, or rewarded by military contracts for their districts? \n",
      "The answer to that question is probably yes. Moreover, both political parties do this. (Frankly, the desire to avoid punishment and seek reward is innate in all creatures)\n",

      "Full Question: Recently, there is a lengthy discussion about HR392 (fairness for skilled immigrant workers) in the US house and senate. It means if this bill will be passed by the house and senate, the limitation of green card for immigrants based on their birth country will be lifted and whoever came first to the US will be served first. As a result, due to huge backlog of Indian and Chinese immigrants waiting for their green card, it will take 10 years for other foreign citizens to be able to apply for adjustment of status. \n",

      "Original Question: Has the abolishment of the FCC fairness doctrine led to political polarization in the US?\n",
      "Full Question: From after World War II the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforced as policy (fairness doctrine), which required broadcasters to discuss controversial matters of public interest and give contrasting views on the matter. For example in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC the supreme court ruled that the FCC could require broadcasters to give individuals free air time to respond to personal on-air attacks.\n",

      "But, doesn't it take away the voice of people in large states? Right now, it seems from our system, that the only votes that count in the US Presidential election, are the ones cast by people in Florida, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Everyone else may as well not vote.\n",

      "Original Question: Have any large governments had any explicit &#39;we won&#39;t assassinate opposing government leaders unless they do X&#39; policies?\n",
      "Full Question: The general rules are that assassinating of leaders of a country are a no-go for any modern country.  partially because of the extreme retaliation that would result, partially because you open the door to your own leadership being assassinated.  Of course plenty of governments have been accused of secretly planning, or even successful pulling off, an assassinating before, but nothing publicly acknowledged.\n",
      "I'm wondering if any large governments, especially more modern ones, have had an open and explicit policy saying that they usually wouldn't assassinate other world leaders unless that leader does some policy.  I don't really care what the policy was, only that they had an explicit \"you're fair game if you do this\" sort of policy.\n",
      "So for example in theory you might have some country warn that anyone who used nuclear weapons, or perhaps used them in a first strike situation, is now open to assassination attempts to discourage more dictatorial countries from having a single crazed leader starting a nuclear war.\n",
      "Again I don't care what policy makes one fair game for assisination, only if there was an explicit warning that the action would make you fair game.  I'd actually settle for a any semi explicit warnings, you know one of those we totally don't assassinate anyone, but we still highly advise you rethink your plans for your own good wink wink, nudge nudge.\n",

      "Full Question: Currently the following things are true:\n",

      "Western countries have frozen most of Russia's foreign currency reserves\n",
      "Russia is either in default or would be soon\n",

      "However #1 is seen as fair and justified by the West, while #2 seems to be at least somewhat condemned. But isn't it only fair for a country to stop paying their debts if their foreign accounts are frozen? This is somewhat nonsensical as the primary reason why the debtors aren't getting their money back is because the debtors own nation has frozen Russia's assets, thus preventing payments from happening. In other words, it would be strange for the West to blame Russia for not paying back after freezing the money they were supposed to use for payments.\n",
